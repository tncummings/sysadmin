Chapter 33 - Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)

= Chapter 33 - Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)

== Chapter 33 Introduction

Pluggable Authentication Modules provide a uniform mechanism to ensure that users and applications are properly identified and authenticated.
Conditional rules can be applied to limit the scope of permissions and control can be established over what to do in case of either success or failure.
PAM can also work with LDAP to centralize authentication throughout a network.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain the basic concepts that motivate the use of PAM.
* List the steps involved in the authentication process.
* Use and modify PAM configuration files.
* Know how to interpret PAM rules and create new ones.
* Apply LDAP to use and administer distributed directory services over the network.

== PAM: A Unified Approach to Authentication

Historically, authentication of users was performed individually by individual applications;
i.e., su, login, and ssh would each authenticate and establish user accounts independently of each other.

Most modern Linux applications have been written or rewritten to exploit PAM so that authentication can be done in one uniform way, using libpam.

This library of modules provides enormous flexibility and consistency with respect to authentication, password, session, and account services.

PAM incorporates the following concepts:

* PAM-aware applications
* Configuration files in /etc/pam.d/
* PAM modules in the libpam* libraries, which can be found in different locations depending on the Linux distribution.

Each PAM-aware application or service may be configured with respect to PAM by an individual configuration file in `/etc/pam.d`.

== Authentication and Configuration Files

Several steps are involved in authentication:

* A user invokes a PAM-aware application, such as login, ssh, or su.
* The application calls libpam.
* The library checks for files in `/etc/pam.d`;
these delineate which PAM modules to invoke, including system-auth.
* Each referenced module is executed in accordance with the rules of the relevant configuration file for that application.

Each file in `/etc/pam.d` corresponds to a service and each (non-commented) line in the file specifies a rule.
The rule is formatted as a list of space-separated tokens, the first two of which are case insensitive:

`type control module-path module-arguments`

As an example, the screenshot here shows what are the contents of `/etc/pam.d/su` on a RHEL system.

Notice that there is a stack here;
su will require loading of system-auth etc.

== PAM Rules

The module type specifies the management group the module is to be associated with:

* *auth*: Instructs the application to prompt the user for identification (username, password, etc).
May set credentials and grant privileges.
* *account*: Checks on aspects of the user's account, such as password aging, access control, etc.
* *password*: Responsible for updating the user authentication token, usually a password.
* *session*: Used to provide functions before and after the session is established (such as setting up environment, logging, etc.).

The control flag controls how the success or failure of a module affects the overall authentication process:

* *required*: Must return success for the service to be granted.
If part of a stack, all other modules are still executed.
Application is not told which module or modules failed.
* *requisite*: Same as required, except a failure in any module terminates the stack and a return status is sent to the application.
* *optional*: Module is not required.
If it is the only module, then its return status to application may cause failure.
* *sufficient*: If this module succeeds, then no subsequent modules in the stack are executed.
If it fails, then it doesn't necessarily cause the stack to fail, unless it is the only one in the stack.

There are other control flags, such as *include* and *substack*.
Please see man pam.d for details.

`module-path` gives the file name of the library to be found in `/lib*/security`, in either absolute or relative path form.

module-arguments can be given to modify the PAM module's behavior.

== LDAP Authentication

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an industry standard protocol for using and administering distributed directory services over the network, and is meant to be both open and vendor-neutral.

When using LDAP for centralized authentication, each system (or client) connects to a centralized LDAP server for user authentication.
Using TLS makes it a secure option and is recommended.

LDAP uses PAM and system-config-authentication or authconfig-tui.
One has to specify the server, search base DN (domain name) and TLS (Transport Layer Security).
Also required is openldap-clients, pam ldap and nss-pam-ldapd.

When you configure a system for LDAP authentication, five files are changed:

`/etc/openldap/ldap.conf` `/etc/pam_ldap.conf` `/etc/nslcd.conf` `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` `/etc/nsswitch.conf`

You can edit these files manually or use one of the utility programs available (`system-config-authentication` or `authconfig-tui`).
