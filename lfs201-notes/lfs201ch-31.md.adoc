Chapter 31 - Group Management

= Chapter 31 - Group Management

== Chapter 31 Introduction

Linux systems form collections of users called groups, whose members share some common purpose.
To further that end, they share certain files and directories and maintain some common privileges;
this separates them from others on the system, sometimes collectively called the world.
Using groups aids collaborative projects enormously.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain why it is useful to have Linux users belong to one or more groups.
* Use utilities such as `groupadd`, `groupdel`, `groupmod`, and `usermod` to create, remove and manipulate groups and their membership.
* Describe User Private Groups.
* Explain the concept of group membership.

== Groups

Linux systems form collections of users called groups, whose members share some common purpose.
To further that end, they share certain files and directories, and maintain some common privileges;
this separates them from others on the system, sometimes collectively called the world.
Using groups aids collaborative projects enormously.
Users belong to one or more groups.

Groups are defined in `/etc/group`, which has the same role for groups as `/etc/passwd` has for users.
Each line of the file looks like:

`+groupname:password:GID:user1,user2,...+`

where:

* groupname is the name of the group
* password is the password place holder.
Group passwords may be set, but only if `/etc/gshadow` exists
* GID is the group identifier.
Values between 0 and 99 are for system groups.
Values between 100 and GID_MIN (as defined in `/etc/login.defs` and usually the same as UID_MIN) are considered special.
Values over GID_MIN are for UPG (User Private Groups)
* user1,user2,\...
is a comma-separated list of users who are members of the group.
The user need not be listed here if this group is the user's principal group.

== Group Management

Group accounts may be managed and maintained with:

* `groupadd`: Add a new group.
* `groupmod`: Modify a group and add new users.
* `groupdel`: Remove a group.
* `usermod`: Manage a user's group memberships.

These group manipulation utilities modify `/etc/group` and (if it exists) `/etc/gshadow`, and may only be executed by root.
Examples:

`$ sudo groupadd -r -g 215 staff` `$ sudo groupmod -g 101 blah` `$ sudo groupdel newgroup` *`$ sudo usermod -G student,group1,group2 student`*

*NOTE*: Be very careful with the usermod -G command;
the group list that follows is the complete list of groups, not just the changes.
Any supplemental groups left out will be gone!
Non-destructive use should utilize the -a option, which will preserve pre-existing group memberships when adding new ones.

== User Private Groups

Linux uses User Private Groups (UPG).

The idea behind UPGs is that each user will have his or her own group.
However, UPGs are not guaranteed to be private;
additional members may be added to someone's private group in `/etc/group`.

By default, users whose accounts are created with useradd have: primary GID = UID and the group name is also identical to the user name.

As specified in `/etc/profile`, the `umask` is set to 002 for all users created with UPG.
Under this scheme, user files are thus created with permissions 664 (rw-rw-r--) and directories with 775 (rwxrwxr-x).
We will discuss `umask` in the next section.

== Group Membership

A Linux user has one primary group;
this is listed in `/etc/passwd` and will also be listed in `/etc/group`.
A user may belong to between 0 and 15 secondary groups.

The primary group is the GID that is used whenever the user creates files or directories.
Membership in other, secondary, groups grants the user additional permissions.

Group membership can be identified by running either of the following commands:

`+$ groups [user1 user2 ...]+` `+$ id -Gn [user1 user2 ...]+`

With no arguments, either command reports on the current user.
Note that the default groups can differ by distribution:

On CentOs:

` [student@CentOS7 ~]$ groups student `

On Ubuntu:

`student@ubuntu:~$ groups` `student adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare libvirt`

== Lab 31.1: Working with Groups

. Create two new user accounts (rocky and bullwinkle in the below) and make sure they have home directories.
. Create two new groups, friends and bosses (with a GID of 490).
Look at `/etc/group` .  See what GID was given to each new group.
. Add rocky to both new groups.
Add bullwinkle to group friends.
Look in `/etc/group` to see how it changed.
. Login as rocky.
Create a directory called somedir and set the group ownership to bosses.
(Using `chgrp` which will be discussed in the next session.) (You will probably need to add execute privileges for all on rocky's home directory.)
. Login as bullwinkle and try to create a file in `/home/rocky/somedir` called somefile using the touch command.
Can you do this?
No, because of the group ownership and the `chmod a+x` on the directory.
. Add bullwinkle to the bosses group and try again.
Note you will have to log out and log back in again for the new group membership to be effective.
do the following:

Solution 31.1 1.
`$ sudo useradd -m rocky` $ `sudo useradd -m bullwinkle` `$ sudo passwd rocky` ` Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password: passwd: password updated successfully ` `$ sudo passwd bullwinkle` ` Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password: passwd: password updated successfully ` `$ ls -l /home` ` total 12 drwxr-xr-x  2 bullwinkle bullwinkle 4096 Oct 30 09:39 bullwinkle drwxr-xr-x  2 rocky      rocky      4096 Oct 30 09:39 rocky drwxr-xr-x 20 student    student    4096 Oct 30 09:18 student `

2.`$ sudo groupadd friends` $ `sudo groupadd -g 490 bosses` $ `grep -e friends -e bosses /etc/group` ` friends:x:1003: bosses:x:490: `

. `$ sudo usermod -G friends,bosses rocky` `$ sudo usermod -G friends bullwinkle` `$ grep -e rocky -e bullwinkle /etc/group` ` rocky:x:1001: bullwinkle:x:1002: friends:x:1003:rocky,bullwinkle bosses:x:490:rocky $ groups rocky bullwinkle rocky : rocky friends bosses bullwinkle : bullwinkle friends `
. `$ ssh rocky@localhost` `$ cd  Ìƒ`` `$ mkdir somedir`` ``$ chgrp bosses somedir`` ``$ ls -l`` ```+ total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 rocky rocky  8980 Oct  4  2013 examples.desktop drwxrwxr-x 2 rocky bosses 4096 Oct 30 09:53 somedir +`` `$ chmod a+x` .
. `$ ssh bullwinkle@localhost` `$ touch /home/rocky/somedir/somefile` `touch: cannot touch /home/rocky/somedir/somefile: Permission denied` `$ exit`
. `$ sudo usermod -a -G bosses bullwinkle` `$ ssh bullwinkle@localhost` `$ touch /home/rocky/somedir/somefile` `$ ls -al /home/rocky/somedir` (note ownership of files)

*MY NOTES*: I had to further modify group privileges to rwx (770) for the directory to be able to write to it.
