Chapter 12 - Process Monitoring

= Chapter 12 - Process Monitoring

## Chapter 12 Introduction

Keeping track of running (and sleeping) processes is an essential system administration task.
The `ps` program has been a main tool for doing so in UNIX-based operating systems for decades.

However, because the utility has a long and complicated history of being used differently in more than one operating system variety, it has a large assortment of options that can be applied with often confusing combinations.
Another trusty tool is provided by `top`, which interactively monitors the system's state.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Use `ps` to view characteristics and statistics associated with processes.
* Identify different `ps` output fields and customize the ps output.
* Use `pstree` to get a visual description of the process ancestry and multi-threaded applications.
* Use `top` to view system loads interactively.

== Process Monitoring Tools

In this section, we will concentrate on process monitoring.
In order to do this, Linux administrators make use of many utilities, such as `ps`, `pstree` and `top`, all of which have long histories in UNIX-like operating systems.

Once again, let us review the list of some of the main tools for process monitoring.
### Utility	Purpose	Package - `top`	Process activity, dynamically updated	procps - `uptime`	How long the system is running and the average load	procps - `ps`	Detailed information about processes	procps - `pstree`	A tree of processes and their connections	psmisc (or pstree) - `mpstat`	Multiple processor usage	sysstat - `iostat`	CPU utilization and I/O statistics	sysstat - `sar` Display and collect information about system activity	sysstat - `numastat`	Information about NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Architecture)	numactl - `strace`	Information about all system calls a process makes	strace

The `/proc` filesystem can also be helpful in monitoring processes, as well as other items, on the system.

== Viewing Process States with ps

`ps` is a workhorse for displaying characteristics and statistics associated with processes, all of which are garnered from the /proc directory associated with the process.

Some common choices of options are:

`$ ps aux`

`$ ps -elf`

`$ ps -eL`

`$ ps -C "bash"`

This command utility has existed in all UNIX-like operating system variants, and that diversity is reflected in the complicated potpourri of options that the Linux version of ps accepts, which fall into three categories:

. UNIX options, which must be preceded by -, and which may be grouped.
. BSD options, which must not be preceded by -, and which may be grouped.
. GNU long options, each of which must be preceded by --.

Having all these possible options can make life rather confusing.
Most system administrators tend to use one or two standard combinations for their daily use.

You can see a typical usage with the BSD option format in the screenshot provided, where the aux option shows all processes.
Commands which are surrounded by square brackets (as in [ksoftirqd/0]) are threads that exist totally within the kernel;
if there is one for each CPU, the command is followed by the integer specifying the CPU it is running on.

Most of the fields in the above example are self-explanatory.
Of the others:

* VSZ is the process' virtual memory size in KB.
* RSS is the resident set size;
the non-swapped physical memory a task is using in KB.
* STAT describes the state of the process;
in our example we see only S for sleeping, or R for running.
The additional character in the state (where it exists) can be:
 ** < for high priority (not nice)
 ** N for low priority (nice)
 ** L for having pages locked in memory
 ** s for session leader
 ** l for multi-threaded
 ** '+' for being in the foreground process group.

Adding the f option will show how processes connect by ancestry, as in:

`$ ps auxf` image:../../_resources/a4ec8781a150495499cc254c8d71bf56.png[dc145bc00cf29f131caf2ade7cfa2c2f.png]

== Customizing the ps Output

If you use the -o option, followed by a comma-separated list of field identifiers, you can print out a customized list of ps fields:

* pid: Process ID number
* uid: User ID number
* cmd: Command with all arguments
* cputime: Cumulative CPU time
* pmem: Ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.

You can see an example in the screenshot below.
You can consult the ps man page for many other output options.

You can see a typical usage with the UNIX option format in the screenshot provided.
Note that it is now showing the Parent Process ID (PPID) and the niceness (NI).
You may observe that many processes show PPID=2 in this example (taken from RHEL 7 and using systemd) an internal kernel process, kthreadd, which is designed to adopt children when the parent process dies.
In older kernels and systems, you would see PPID=1 for sbin/init, but it is really the same thing going on.

Some common selection options in the UNIX format are:

* -A or -e: Select all processes
* -N: Negate selection (means do the opposite)
* -C: Select by command name
* -G: Select by real group ID (also supports names)
* -U: Select by real user ID (also supports names).

== Using pstree

`pstree` gives a visual description of the process ancestry and multi-threaded applications:

``` $ pstree -aAp 2408

bash,2408 |-emacs,24998 pmonitor.tex |  |-\{emacs},25002 |  '-\{emacs},25003 |-evince,18036 LFS201-SLIDES.pdf |  |-\{evince},18040 |  |-\{evince},18046 |  '-\{evince},18047 ```

Consult the man page for pstree for an explanation of many options;
in the above we have chosen just to show information for pid=2408.

Note that one of its child processes (evince, pid=18036) has three children of its own.
Another way to see that is:

``` $ ls -l /proc/18036/task

total 0 dr-xr-xr-x 5 coop coop 0 Sep 11 07:15 18036 dr-xr-xr-x 5 coop coop 0 Sep 11 07:15 18040 dr-xr-xr-x 5 coop coop 0 Sep 11 07:15 18046 dr-xr-xr-x 5 coop coop 0 Sep 11 07:15 18047 ``` ## top

When you want to know what the system is spending its time on, the first tool you often use is `top`.
The screenshot shows you what you can see when using `top` without arguments.
By default, top refreshes itself every 3.0 seconds.

`top` is an ancient utility and has a ton of options, as well as interactive commands triggered when certain keys are pressed.
For example, if you hit 1, each CPU is shown separately, and if you hit i, only active processes are shown.
You can see what doing both gives you in the screenshot.

image::../../_resources/be6547d72df946d980d5f0064cf5168c.png[56dbf0a927ad751dd1213a577cf9b345.png]

You have a lot of control over how processes are sorted and which fields are displayed;
there are many others besides the defaults.
For example, hitting *h* or *?* gives a brief list of interactive commands and `q` exits.

Furthermore, you can kill a task by hitting *k*, or *renice* it (change its priority) with *r*.

Doing `man top` will give you extensive documentation on configuration possibilities, options, and interactive possibilities.

Note that there are popular alternatives to the standard top program, some of which have more visual interfaces and/or additional information, such as htop, ntop and atop.
And most Linux distributions have a graphical system monitor (such as gnome-system-monitor or ksysguard) which has a top-like display window that can be shown.

== Exercise 12.1: Processes

. Run ps with the options -ef.
Then run it again with the options aux.
Note the differences in the output.
. Run ps so that only the process ID, priority, nice value, and the process command line are displayed.
. Start a new bash session by typing bash at the command line.
Start another bash session using the nice command but this time giving it a nice value of 10.
. Run ps as in step 2 to note the differences in priority and nice values.
Note the process ID of the two bash sessions.
. Change the nice value of one of the bash sessions to 15 using renice . Once again, observe the change in priority and nice values.
. Run top and watch the output as it changes.
Hit q to stop the program.

== Exercise 12.2: Monitoring Process States

. Use dd to start a background process which reads from /dev/urandom and writes to /dev/null.
. Check the process state.
What should it be?
. Bring the process to the foreground using the fg command.
Then hit Ctrl-Z.
What does this do?
Look at the process state again, what is it?
. Run the jobs program.
What does it tell you?
. Bring the job back to the foreground, then terminate it using kill from another window.

``` tom@aur6a:~$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null & [1] 35611 tom@aur6a:~$

tom@aur6a:~$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null & [1] 35611 tom@aur6a:~$ ps -C dd -o pid,stat,priority     PID STAT PRI   35611 R     20 tom@aur6a:~$ fg dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null ` * * * ` tom@aur6a:~$ ps -C dd -o pid,stat,priority     PID STAT PRI   35611 R+    20 tom@aur6a:~$ kill 35611 tom@aur6a:~$ ```
