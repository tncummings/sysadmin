Chapter 41 - Linux Security Modules

= Chapter 41 - Linux Security Modules

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Understand how the Linux Security Module framework works and how it is deployed.
* List the various *LSM* implementations available.
* Delineate the main features of *SELinux*.
* Explain the different modes and policies available.
* Grasp the importance of contexts and how to get and set them.
* Know how to use the important SELinux utility programs.
* Gain some familiarity with *AppArmor*.

== What Are Linux Security Modules?

A modern computer system must be made secure, but needs vary according to sensitivity of data, number of users with accounts, exposure to outside networks, legal requirements and other factors.
Responsibility for enabling good security controls falls both on application designers and the Linux kernel developers and maintainers.
Of course, users have to follow good procedures as well, but on a well-run system, non-privileged users should have very limited ability to expose the system to security violations.
In this section, we are concerned with how the Linux kernel enhances security through the use of the Linux Security Modules framework, particularly with the deployment of SELinux.
The idea is to implement mandatory access controls over the variety of requests made to the kernel, but to do so in a way that:

* Minimizes changes to the kernel
* Minimizes overhead on the kernel
* Permits flexibility and choice between different implementations, each of which is presented as a self-contained LSM (Linux Security Module).

The basic idea is to hook system calls;
*insert code whenever an application requests a transition to kernel (system) mode in order to accomplish work that requires enhanced abilities;* this code makes sure permissions are valid, malicious intent is protected against, etc.
It does this by invoking security-related functional steps before and/or after a system call is fulfilled by the kernel.

== Main LSM Choices

For a long time, the only enhanced security model implemented was SELinux.
When the project was first floated upstream in 2001 to be included directly in the kernel, there were objections about using only one approach to enhanced security.

As a result, the LSM approach was adopted, where alternative modules to SELinux could be used as they were developed and was incorporated into the Linux kernel in 2003.

The current LSM implementations are:

* SELinux
* AppArmor
* Smack
* Tomoyo image:../../_resources/4a556b777a614700ab07f2c49fa6756e.png[27746bd1d5a55856dae16f6f1d045b33.png]

LSMs are now considered as either major or minor when configuring their combination.

We will concentrate primarily on SELinux and secondarily on AppArmor in order of usage volume.

See https://www.starlab.io/blog/a-brief-tour-of-linux-security-modules["A Brief Tour of Linux Security Modules"] by Shaun Ruffell for a nice review of the mechanism and choices.

== SELinux Overview

SELinux was originally developed by the United States NSA (National Security Administration) and has been integral to RHEL for a very long time, which has brought it a large usage base.

Operationally, SELinux is a set of security rules that are used to determine which processes can access which files, directories, ports, and other items on the system.

It works with three conceptual quantities.

*_Contexts_*: Contexts are labels to files, processes and ports.
Examples of contexts are SELinux user, role and type.

*_Rules_*: Rules describe access control in terms of contexts, processes, files, ports, users, etc.

*_Policies_*: Policies are a set of rules that describe what system-wide access control decisions should be made by SELinux.

A SELinux context is a name used by a rule to define how users, processes, files and ports interact with each other.
As the default policy is to deny any access, rules are used to describe allowed actions on the system.

Additional online documentation can be found in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/index[SELinux User's and Administrator's Guide].

== SELinux Enforcement Modes

SELinux can be run under one of three modes.

*_Enforcing_*: All SELinux code is operative and access is denied according to policy.
All violations are audited and logged.
image:../../_resources/a57913377e8b47c39f95998c6c30f3e3.png[b9f292573f6b0b57e764e779a3005c7c.png]

*_Permissive_*: Enables SELinux code, but only audits and warns about operations that would be denied in enforcing mode.
image:../../_resources/828d0dd8973b451bb073322b511dcbe9.png[d3c01b759dcab5ec0f973f9f67edb101.png]

These modes are selected (and explained) in `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` (CentOS and openSUSE) or `/etc/selinux/config` (Ubuntu).

The *`sestatus`* utility can display the current mode and policy.

== `getenforce` and `setenforce`

To examine or set the current mode, you can use getenforce and setenforce:

` $ getenforce Enforcing `

` $ sudo setenforce Permissive $ getenforce Permissive `

`setenforce` can be used to switch between enforcing and permissive modes on the fly while the system is in operation.
However, changing in or out of the disabled mode cannot be done this way.

While setenforce allows you to switch between permissive and enforcing modes, it does not allow you to disable SELinux completely.
There are at least two different ways to disable SELinux:

* *_Configuration file_*: Edit the SELinux configuration file (usually /etc/selinux/config) and set SELINUX=disabled.
This is the default method and should be used to permanently disable SELinux.
* *_Kernel parameter_*: Add selinux=0 to the kernel parameter list when rebooting.

However, it is important to note that disabling SELinux on systems in which SELinux will be re-enabled is not recommended.
It is preferable to use the permissive mode instead of disabling SELinux, so as to avoid relabeling the entire filesystem, which can be time-consuming.

== SELinux Policies

The same configuration file that sets the mode, usually `/etc/sysconfig/selinux`, also sets the SELinux policy.
Multiple policies are allowed, but only one can be active at a time.
Changing the policy may require a reboot of the system and a time-consuming re-labeling of filesystem contents.
Each policy has files which must be installed under `etc/selinux/[SELINUXTYPE]`.

* *_Targeted_*: The default policy in which SELinux is more restricted to targeted processes.
User processes and init processes are not targeted, while network service processes are targeted.
SELinux enforces memory restrictions for all processes, which reduces the vulnerability to buffer overflow attacks.
* *_Minimum_*: A modification of the targeted policy where only selected processes are protected.
* *_MLS_*: The Multi-Level Security policy is much more restrictive;
all processes are placed in fine-grained security domains with particular policies.

== Context Utilities

As mentioned earlier, contexts are labels applied to files, directories, ports, and processes.
Those labels are used to describe access rules.
There are four SELinux contexts:

. User
. Role
. Type
. Level

However, we will focus on type, which is the most commonly utilized context.
The label naming convention determines that type context labels should end with _t, as in kernel_t.

Use the -Z option to see the context:

`$ ls -Z` `$ ps auZ`

Use the chcon command to change context:

`$ chcon -t etc_t somefile` `$ chcon --reference somefile someotherfile`

``` $ ls -Z

-rw-rw-r--.
dog dog unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 somefile ```

``` $ chcon -t etc_t somefile $ ls -Z

-rw-rw-r--.
dog dog unconfined_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 somefile ```

``` $ ls -Z

-rw-rw-r--.
dog dog unconfined_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 somefile -rw-rw-r--.
dog dog unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 somefile1 ```

``` $ chcon --reference somefile somefile1 $ ls -Z

-rw-rw-r--.
dog dog unconfined_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 somefile -rw-rw-r--.
dog dog unconfined_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 somefile1 ```

== SELinux and Standard Commands

Many standard command line commands, such as ls and ps, were extended to support SELinux, and corresponding sections were added to their man pages explaining the details.
Often the parameter Z is passed to standard command line tools, as in:

`+ $ ps axZ LABEL PID TTY STAT TIME COMMAND system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 1 ?
Ss 0:04 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root ...
system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0 2 ?
S 0:00 [kthreadd] ...
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 2305 ?
D 0:00 sshd: jimih@pts/0 unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 2306 pts/0 Ss 0:00 -bash ...
system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 7490 ?
Ss 0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 7491 ?
S 0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND ...
+`

` $ ls -Z /home/ /tmp/ /home/: drwx------.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_dir_t:s0 jimih /tmp/: -rwx------.
root root system_u:object_r:initrc_tmp_t:s0 ks-script-c4ENhg drwx------.
root root system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0 systemd-private-0ofSvO -rw-------.
root root system_u:object_r:initrc_tmp_t:s0 dnf.log `

Other tools that were extended to support SELinux include cp, mv, and mkdir.

Note that if you have disabled SELinux, no useful information is displayed in the related fields from these utilities.

== Context Inheritance

Newly created files inherit the context from their parent directory, but when moving files, it is the context of the source directory which may be preserved, which can cause problems.

Continuing the previous example, we see the context of tmpfile was not changed by moving the file from /tmp to /home/jimih:

` $ cd /tmp/ $ touch tmpfile $ ls -Z tmpfile -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 tmpfile `

` $ cd $ touch homefile $ ls -Z homefile -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 homefile `

` $ mv /tmp/tmpfile . $ ls -Z -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 homefile -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 tmpfile `

The classical example in which moving files creates a SELinux issue is moving files to the DocumentRoot directory of the httpd server.
On SELinux-enabled systems, the web server can only access files with the correct context labels.
Creating a file in /tmp, and then moving it to the DocumentRoot directory, will make the file unaccessible to the httpd server until the SELinux context of the file is adjusted.

== `restorecon`

`restorecon` resets file contexts, based on parent directory settings.
In the following example, restorecon resets the default label recursively for all files at the home directory:

` $ ls -Z -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 homefile -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 tmpfile `

`+ $ restorecon -Rv /home/jimih restorecon reset /home/jimih/tmpfile context \ unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0->unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 +`

` $ ls -Z -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 homefile -rw-rw-r--.
jimih jimih unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tmpfile `

Note that the context for tmpfile has been reset to the default context for files created at the home directory.
The type was changed from *user_tmp_t* to *user_home_t*.

== `semanage`

Another issue is how to configure the default context for a newly created directory.
`semanage fcontext` (provided by the *policycoreutils-python package*) can change and display the default context of files and directories.
Note that `semanage fcontext` only changes the default settings;
it does not apply them to existing objects.
This requires calling restorecon afterwards.
For example:

``` [root@rhel7 /]# mkdir /virtualHosts [root@rhel7 /]# ls -Z \...
drwxr-xr-x.
root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 virtualHosts

[root@rhel7 /]# semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t /virtualHosts [root@rhel7 /]# ls -Z \...
drwxr-xr-x.
root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 virtualHosts

[root@rhel7 /]# restorecon -RFv /virtualHosts restorecon reset /virtualHosts context unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0\->system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0

[root@rhel7 /]# ls -Z drwxr-xr-x.
root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 virtualHosts ```

The context change from default_t to httpd_sys_content_t is thus only applied after the call to restorecon.

== Using SELinux Booleans

SELinux policy behavior can be configured at runtime without rewriting the policy.
This is accomplished by configuring SELinux Booleans, which are policy parameters that can be enabled and disabled:

* `getsebool` - to see booleans
* `setsebool` - to set booleans
* `semanage boolean -l` - to see persistent boolean settings.

You can see what you need to do to list all booleans of the current policy, including the current status and a short description in the screenshot below.

`+ $ setsebool allow_ftpd_anon_write on $ getsebool allow_ftpd_anon_write   allow_ftpd_anon_write -> on $ semanage boolean -l | grep allow_ftpd_anon_write $ allow_ftpd_anon_write -> off +`

Note not persistent.

`+ $ setsebool -P allow_ftpd_anon_write on $ semanage boolean -l | grep allow_ftpd_anon_write   allow_ftpd_anon_write         -> on +`

Now persistent.

== Monitoring SELinux Access

SELinux comes with a set of tools that collect issues at run time, log these issues and propose solutions to prevent same issues from happening again.
These utilities are provided by the *setroubleshoot-server* package.
Here is an example of their use:

`+ [root@rhel7 ~]# echo 'File created at /root' > rootfile [root@rhel7 ~]# mv rootfile /var/www/html/ [root@rhel7 ~]# wget -O - localhost/rootfile --2014-11-21 13:42:04-- http://localhost/rootfile Resolving localhost (localhost)...

+`

``` [root@rhel7 ~]# tail /var/log/messages Nov 21 13:42:04 rhel7 setroubleshoot: Plugin Exception restorecon Nov 21 13:42:04 rhel7 setroubleshoot: SELinux is preventing /usr/sbin/httpd from getattr access on the file . For complete SELinux messages.

== AppArmor

AppArmor is an LSM alternative to SELinux.
Support for it has been incorporated in the Linux kernel since 2006.
It has been used by SUSE, Ubuntu and other distributions.

AppArmor:

* Provides Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
* Allows administrators to associate a security profile to a program which restricts its capabilities
* Is considered easier (by some but not all) to use than SELinux
* Is considered filesystem-neutral (no security labels required).

AppArmor supplements the traditional UNIX Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model by providing Mandatory Access Control (MAC).

In addition to manually specifying profiles, AppArmor includes a learning mode, in which violations of the profile are logged, but not prevented.
This log can then be turned into a profile, based on the program's typical behavior.

== Checking Status

Distributions that come with AppArmor tend to enable it and load it by default.
Note that the Linux kernel has to have it turned on as well, and, in most cases, only one LSM can run at a time.

Assuming you have the AppArmor kernel module available, on a systemd-equipped system you can do:

`$ sudo systemctl [start|stop|restart|status] apparmor`

to change or inquire about the current state of operation, or do:

`$ sudo systemctl [enable|disable} apparmor`

to cause to be loaded or not loaded at boot.

In order to see the current status, do:

`+ $ sudo apparmor_status  apparmor module is loaded.
25 profiles are loaded.
25 profiles are in enforce mode.
/sbin/dhclient ...
+`

Profiles and processes are in either enforce or complain mode, directly analogous to SELinux's enforcing and permissive modes.
Note that in the process, listing the PID is given:

` $ ps aux | grep libvirtd root     787  0.0  0.9  527200  35936 ?
Ssl  10:54 0:00 /usr/sbin/libvirtd student 3346  0.0  0.0   13696   2204 pts/16 S+   11:42 0:00 grep --color=auto libvirtd `

== Modes and Profiles

Profiles restrict how executable programs, which have pathnames on your system, such as `/usr/bin/evince`, can be used.

Processes can be run in either of the two modes:

. *_Enforce Mode_*: Applications are prevented from acting in ways which are restricted.
Attempted violations are reported to the system logging files.
This is the default mode.
A profile can be set to this mode with aa-enforce.
. *_Complain Mode_*: Policies are not enforced, but attempted policy violations are reported.
This is also called the learning mode.
A profile can be set to this mode with aa-complain.

Linux distributions come with pre-packaged profiles, typically installed either when a given package is installed, or with an AppArmor package, such as apparmor-profiles.
These profiles are stored in `/etc/apparmor.d`.

When installing new software, new profiles can be created specific to any executables in the package.

Exactly what AppArmor profiles are installed on your system depends on your selection of software packages.
For example, on one particular Ubuntu system:

`+ student@ubuntu: /etc/apparmor.d$ ls abstractions                usr.lib.dovecot.anvil            usr.lib.telepathy apache2.d                   usr.lib.dovecot.auth             usr.sbin.avahi-daemon bin.ping                    usr.lib.dovecot.config           usr.sbin.cups-brows ...
+`

Full documentation on what can go in these files can be obtained by doing `man apparmor.d`.

== AppArmor Utilities

AppArmor has quite a few administrative utilities for monitoring and control.
For example, on an openSUSE system:

`+ $ rpm -qil apparmor-utils | grep bin /usr/bin/aa-easyprof /usr/sbin/aa-audit /usr/sbin/aa-autodep /usr/sbin/aa-cleanprof /usr/sbin/aa-complain /usr/sbin/aa-decode /usr/sbin/aa-disable /usr/sbin/aa-enforce /usr/sbin/aa-exec ....
/usr/sbin/complain /usr/sbin/decode /usr/sbin/disable /usr/sbin/enforce ....
+`

Note that many of these utilities can be invoked with either their short or long names;
e.g.:

`+ linux-llgn:/etc/apparmor.d # ls -l /usr/sbin/*complain -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1442 Oct 25 07:37 /usr/sbin/aa-complain* lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   11 Nov 11 13:02 /usr/sbin/complain -> aa-complain* linux-llgn:/etc/apparmor.d # +` image:../../_resources/d154398523424f1cb47c87af75940e99.png[b855b7569107d3abf15da0372343e647.png]

== Lab 41.1. SELinux Contexts

. Verify SELinux is enabled and in enforcing mode, by executing getenforce and sestatus.
If not, edit /etc/selinux/ config, reboot, and check again.
. Install  the httpd package  (if  not  already  present)  which  provides  the Apache web  server,  and  then  verify  that  it  is working: ` $ sudo dnf install  httpd $ elinks http:/localhost ` (You can also use lynx or elinks etc.
as the browser, or use your graphical browser such as firefox or chrome , in this and succeeding steps.)
. As superuser, create a small file in /var/www/html: `$ sudo sh -c "echo file1 > /var/www/html/file1.html"`
. Verify you can see it: `+$ elinks -dump http://localhost/file1.html+`

``` [ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-213 ~]$ pwd /home/ec2-user [ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-213 ~]$ sudo vi ./file2.html [ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-213 ~]$ sudo mv file2.html /var/www/html/ [ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-213 ~]$ curl http://localhost/file2.html <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">+++<html>++++++<head>++++++<title>+++403 Forbidden+++</title>++++++</head>++++++<body>+++You don't have permission to access this resource.+++</body>++++++</html>+++

== Lab 41.2: Exploring apparmor security

On Ubuntu, the /bin/ping utility runs with SUID enabled.
For this exercise, we will copy ping to ping-x and adjust the capabilities so the program functions.
Then we will build an AppArmor profile, install and verify that nothing has changed.
Modifying the AppArmor profile and adding capabilities will allow the program more functionality.

. Make sure all necessary packages are installed: `student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo apt-get install apparm*`
. Create a copy of ping (called ping-x) and verify it has no initial special permissions or capabilities.
Furthermore, it cannot work when executed by student, a normal user: ` student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo cp /bin/ping /bin/ping-x student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo ls -l /bin/ping-x -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 64424 Oct 17 10:12 /bin/ping-x student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo getcap /bin/ping-x student@ubuntu:˜$ student@ubuntu:˜$ ping-x -c3 -4 127.0.0.1 ping: socket: Operation not permitted `
. Set the capabilities and re-try ping-x: ``` student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep student@ubuntu:˜$ ping-x -c3 -4 127.0.0.1 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 /bin/ping-x data.
time=0.092 ms time=0.093 ms time=0.086 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2034ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.086/0.090/0.093/0.008 ms

The modified ping-x program now functions normally.
```

. Verify there is no pre-existing AppArmor profile for ping-x, but there is a profile for ping.
Determine the status of the current ping program:

`student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo aa-status`

The output from aa-status is long, so we can grep for the interesting lines:

` student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo aa-status | grep -e "ˆ[[:alnum:]]" -e ping apparmor module is loaded.
87 profiles are loaded.
51 profiles are in enforce mode.
ping 36 profiles are in complain mode.
17 processes have profiles defined.
6 processes are in enforce mode.
11 processes are in complain mode.
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.
`

We can see ping has a profile that is loaded and enabled for enforcement.

. Next we will construct a new profile for ping-x.
This step requires two terminal windows.
The first window (window1)will be running the aa-genprof command.
This will generate a AppArmor profile by scanning /var/log/syslog for AppArmor errors.
The second window (window2) will be used to run ping-x.
(See the man page for aa-genprof for additional information.)

In window1: `+ student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo aa-genprof /bin/ping-x Writing updated profile for /bin/ping-x.
Setting /bin/ping-x to complain mode.
Before you begin, you may wish to check if a profile already exists for the application you wish to confine.
See the following wiki page for more information: http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Profiles Please start the application to be profiled in another window and exercise its functionality now.
Once completed, select the "Scan" option below in order to scan the system logs for AppArmor events.
For each AppArmor event, you will be given the opportunity to choose whether the access should be allowed or denied.
Profiling: /bin/ping-x [(S)can system log for AppArmor events] / (F)inish +`

In window2: ``` student@ubuntu:˜$ ping-x -c3 -4 127.0.0.1 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64

data.

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2041ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.099/0.111/0.120/0.008 ms ```

In window1: The command ping-x has completed, we must now instruct aa-genprof to scan for the required information to be added to the profile.
It may require several scans to collect all of the information for the profile.

See the following wiki page for more information: http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Profiles Finished generating profile for /bin/ping-x.

. View the created profile, which has been stored in /etc/appamor.d/bin.ping-x.

` student@ubuntu:˜$ sudo cat /etc/apparmor.d/bin.ping-x #Last Modified: Tue Oct 17 11:30:47 2017 #include <tunables/global> /bin/ping-x { #include <abstractions/base> #include <abstractions/nameservice> capability net_raw, network inet raw, /bin/ping-x mr, /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-*.so mr, } `

. The aa-genproc utility installs and activates the new policy so it should be ready to use, and the policies can be reloaded on demand with the systemctl reload apparmor command.
To avoid any potential issues, and verify the changes will survive, reboot the system.
Once the system has restarted, as the user student, verify ping-x still functions with the new profile enabled.
Ping the localhost by ip address:

``` student@ubuntu:˜$ ping-x -c3 -4 127.0.0.1 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64

data.
time=0.057 ms time=0.043 ms time=0.095 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2027ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.043/0.065/0.095/0.021 ms ```

. This should work as expected.
The profile is very specific, and AppArmor will not allow functionality outside of the specified parameters.
To verify AppArmor is protecting this application, try to ping the IPV6 localhost address.
This should fail:

` student@ubuntu:˜$ ping-x -c3 -6 ::1 ping: socket: Permission denied `

(Note, the -6 option means use only IPv6 and ::1 is the local host in IPv6.) The output indicates there is a socket issue.
If the system log is examined it will be discovered that our ping-x program has no access to IPv6 within AppArmor:

` 766:104): apparmor="DENIED" operation="create" profile="/bin/ping-x" pid=2709 comm="ping-x" family="inet6" sock_type="raw" protocol=58 requested_mask="create" denied_mask="create `

. To correct this deficiency, re-run aa-genprof as we did earlier, and in window2, ping the IPv6 loopback and append the additional options
