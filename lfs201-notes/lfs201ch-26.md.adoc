Chapter 26 - Kernel Modules

= Chapter 26 - Kernel Modules

== Chapter 26 Introduction

The Linux kernel makes extensive use of modules, which contain important software that can be loaded and unloaded as needed after the system starts.
Many modules incorporate device drivers to control hardware either inside the system or attached peripherally.
Other modules can control network protocols, support different filesystem types and many other purposes.
Parameters can be specified when loading modules to control their behavior.
The end result is great flexibility and agility in responding to changing conditions and needs.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* List the advantages of utilizing kernel modules.
* Use insmod, rmmod and modprobe to load and unload kernel modules.
* Use modinfo to find out information about kernel modules.

== Kernel Modules

Many facilities in the Linux kernel are designed to be built-in to the kernel when it is initially loaded, or to be added (or removed) later as modules as necessary.
Indeed, all but the most central kernel components are integrated in such a fashion.

Such modules may or may not be device drivers.
For example, they may implement a certain network protocol or filesystem rather than drive a hardware or software device.
Even in cases where the functionality will virtually always be needed, incorporation of the ability to load and unload as a module facilitates development, as kernel reboots are not required to test changes.

Even with the widespread usage of kernel modules, Linux retains a monolithic kernel architecture, rather than a microkernel one.
This is because once a module is loaded, it becomes a fully functional part of the kernel, with few restrictions.
It communicates with all kernel sub-systems primarily through shared resources, such as memory and locks, rather than through message passing as might a microkernel.

Linux is hardly the only operating system to use modules;
Solaris does it as well, as does AIX, which terms them kernel extensions.
However, Linux uses them in a particularly robust fashion.

== Listing Modules in Use with `lsmod`

Most kernel features can be configured as modules, even if they are almost always likely to be used.
This flexibility also aids in development of new features as system reboots are almost never needed to test during development and debugging.

While other operating systems have used module-like methods, Linux uses it far more than any other operating system.

While the module is loaded, you can always see its status with lsmod, as in the screenshot below.

Module removal can always be done directly with:

`$ sudo /sbin/rmmod module_name`

Note that it is not necessary to supply either the full path name or the .ko extension when removing a module.

Module loading and unloading must be done as the root user.
If the full path name is known, you can always load the module directly with:

`$ sudo /sbin/insmod <pathto>/module_name.ko`

The normal filesystem location for kernel modules is under the directory tree at `/lib/modules/<kernel-version>`.
A kernel module always has a file extension of .ko, as in e1000e.ko, ext4.ko, or usbserial.ko.

Kernel modules are kernel version specific and must match the running kernel or they cannot be loaded.
They must be compiled either when the kernel itself is compiled, or later, on a system which retains enough of the kernel source and compilation configuration to do this properly.

== Module Utilities

There are a number of utility programs that are used with kernel modules:

* `lsmod`: List loaded modules.
* `insmod`: Directly load modules.
* `rmmod`: Directly remove modules.
* `modprobe`: Load or unload modules, using a pre-built module database with dependency and location information.
* `depmod`: Rebuild the module dependency database;
needed by modprobe and modinfo.
* `modinfo`: Display information about a module.

Use `modprobe` to load a module:

`$ modprobe e1000e`

Use `modprobe -r` to unload or remove a module:

`$ modprobe -r e1000e`

`modprobe` requires a module dependency database be updated.
Use `depmod` to generate or update the file `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep`.

Use `insmod` to directly load a module (requires fully qualified module name):

`$ insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e.ko`

Use `rmmod` to directly remove a module:

`$ rmmod e1000e`

Use `lsmod` to list the loaded modules:

`$ lsmod`

Use `modinfo` to display information about a module (including parameters):

`$ modinfo e1000e`

== Some Considerations with Modules

There are some important things to keep in mind when loading and unloading modules:

* It is impossible to unload a module being used by one or more other modules, which one can ascertain from the lsmod listing.
* It is impossible to unload a module that is being used by one or more processes, which can also be seen from the lsmod listing.
However, there are modules which do not keep track of this reference count, such as network device driver modules, as it would make it too difficult to temporarily replace a module without shutting down and restarting much of the whole network stack.
* When a module is loaded with modprobe, the system will automatically load any other modules that need to be loaded first.
* When a module is unloaded with modprobe -r, the system will automatically unload any other modules being used by the module, if they are not being simultaneously used by any other loaded modules.

== `modinfo` Example

`modinfo` can be used to find out information about kernel modules (whether or not they are currently loaded), as in:

`$ /sbin/modinfo my_module`

`$ /sbin/modinfo <pathto>/my_module.ko`

You can see an example in the screenshot here, which displays information about version, file name, which hardware devices the device driver module can handle, and what parameters can be supplied on loading.

Much information about modules can also be seen in the `/sys` pseudo-filesystem directory tree;
in our example, you would look under `/sys/module/e1000` and some, if not all parameters, can be read and/or written under `/sys/module/e1000/parameters`.
We will show how to set them next.

Many modules can be loaded while specifying parameter values, such as in:

`$ sudo /sbin/insmod <pathto>/e1000e.ko debug=2 copybreak=256`

or, for a module already in the proper system location, it is easier with:

`$ sudo /sbin/modprobe e1000e debug=2 copybreak=256`

== `/etc/modprobe.d`

All files in the `/etc/modprobe.d` subdirectory tree which end with the .conf extension are scanned when modules are loaded and unloaded using modprobe.
Files in the `/etc/modprobe.d` directory control some parameters that come into play when loading with modprobe.
These parameters include module name aliases and automatically supplied options.
You can also blacklist specific modules to avoid them being loaded.

Settings apply to modules as they are loaded or unloaded, and configurations can be changed as needs change.

The format of files in `/etc/modprobe.d` is simple: one command per line, with blank lines and lines starting with # ignored (useful for adding comments).
A backslash at the end of a line causes it to continue on the next line, which makes the file a bit neater.

== Lab 26.1: Kernel Modules

. List all currently loaded kernel modules on your system.
. Load a currently unloaded module on your system.
If you are running a distribution kernel,  this is easy to find;
you can simply look in the /lib/modules/< kernel-version >/kernel/drivers/net directory and grab one.
(Distribution kernels come with drivers for every device, filesystem, network protocol etc.
that a system might need.) However, if you are running a custom kernel you may not have many unloaded modules compiled.
A choice that will usually work is to pick either e1000.ko or e1000e.ko, as while these gigabit Ethernet drivers are quite common, it is very unlikely both would be loaded at once.
. Re-list all loaded kernel modules and see if your module was indeed loaded.
. Remove the loaded module from your system.
. Re-list again and see if your module was properly removed.
