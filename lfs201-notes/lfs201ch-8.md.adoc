= Chapter 8 - Yum (Yellow Dog Updater, Modified)

Created Wednesday 27 January 2021

== Chapter 8 Introduction

The yum program provides a higher level of intelligent services for using the underlying rpm program.
It can automatically resolve dependencies when installing, updating and removing packages.
It accesses external software repositories, synchronizing with them and retrieving and installing software as needed.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Discuss package installers and their characteristics.
* Explain how yum works as a high-level package management system.
* Configure yum to use repositories.
* Discuss the queries yum can be used for.
* Verify, install, remove, and upgrade packages using yum.
* Learn about additional commands and how to install new repositories.
* Understand how to use dnf, which has replaced yum on Fedora.

== Package Installers

The lower-level package utilities such as rpm and dpkg deal with the details of installing specific software package files and managing already installed software.

The higher-level package management systems (such as yum, dnf, apt and zypper) work with databases of available software and incorporate the tools needed to find, install, update, and uninstall software in a highly intelligent fashion.
They:

* Can use both local and remote repositories as a source to install and update binary, as well as source software packages.
* Are used to automate the install, upgrade, and removal of software packages.
* Resolve dependencies automatically.
* Save time because there is no need to either download packages manually or search out dependency information separately.

The software repositories are provided by distributions and other independent software providers.
The package installers maintain databases of available software derived from catalogs kept by the repositories.
Unlike the low-level package tools, they have the ability to find and install dependencies automatically, which is a critical feature.

In this section, we will talk about yum and dnf;
we will get to zypper and apt next.

yum provides a frontend to rpm.
Its primary task is to fetch packages from multiple remote repositories and resolve dependencies among packages.
It is used by the majority (but not all) of distributions that use rpm, including RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux and Fedora.

== What is Yum?

yum caches information and databases to speed up performance.
To remove some or all cached information, you can run the command:

`$ yum clean [ packages | metadata | expire-cache | rpmdb | plugins | all ]`

yum has a number of modular extensions (plugins) and companion programs that can be found under `/usr/bin/yum*` and `/usr/sbin/yum*`.

We will concentrate on the command line use of yum and not consider the graphical interfaces distributions provide.

Repository configuration files are kept in `/etc/yum.repos.d/` and have a `.repo` extension.
For example, on one RHEL 7 system we have: image:../../_resources/6f8d4fa32a3549b58b89d84d0d728d17.png[9aa7b8c1c418fbff24015c03479dccc7.png]

A very simple repository file might look like:

[repo-name]     name=Description of the repository     baseurl= http://somesystem.com/path/to/repo     enabled=1

More complicated examples can be found in /etc/yum.repos.d and it would be a good idea to examine them.

You can toggle the use of a particular repository on or off by changing the value of enabled to 0 or 1, or using the --disablerepo=somerepo and --enablerepo=somerepo options when using yum.

You can (but should not) also turn off integrity checking with the gpgcheck variable.

Below is a section of an actual Redhat 8 repo file:

`+ [rhel-8-appstream-rhui-rpms] name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for $basearch - AppStream from RHUI (RPMs) mirrorlist=https://rhui3.REGION.aws.ce.redhat.com/pulp/mirror/content/dist/rhel8 /rhui/$releasever/$basearch/appstream/os enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release sslverify=1 sslclientkey=/etc/pki/rhui/content-rhel8.key sslclientcert=/etc/pki/rhui/product/content-rhel8.crt sslcacert=/etc/pki/rhui/cdn.redhat.com-chain.crt +`

== Queries

Like rpm, yum can be used for queries such as searches;
however, it can search not just what is present on the local system, it can also inquire about remote repositories.

=== Search for packages with keyword in name:

` $ sudo yum search keyword $ sudo yum list "*keyword*" `

These two commands give somewhat different information.
The first one tells more about the packages, while the second one makes it clearer what is installed and what else is available.

=== Display information about a package:

`$ sudo yum info package`

Information includes size, version, what repository it came from, a source URL, and a longer description.
Wildcards can be given, as in yum info "libc*", for this and most yum commands.
Note that the package need not be installed, unlike queries made with rpm -q.

=== List all packages, or just those installed, available, or updates that have not yet been installed:

`$ sudo yum list [installed | updates | available ]`

=== Show information about package groups installed or available, etc.:

` $ sudo yum grouplist [group1] [group2] $ sudo yum groupinfo group1 [group2] `

=== Show packages that contain a certain file name:

`$ sudo yum provides /path/to/file`

Please note the need to use at least one / in the file name, which can be confusing.

== Verifying Packages

Package verification requires installation of the yum-plugin-verify package.
So, you might have to do:

`$ sudo yum install yum-plugin-verify`

Note that this is a yum plugin, not an executable.
There are many other plugins available for yum, which extend the possible set of commands and arguments it can take.

=== To verify a package, giving the most information:

`$ sudo yum verify [package]`

=== To mimic rpm -V exactly:

`$ sudo yum verify-rpm [package]`

=== To list all differences, including configuration files:

`$ sudo yum verify-all [package]`

Without arguments, the above commands will verify all packages installed on the system.

By default, the verification commands ignore configuration files which may change through normal and safe usage.
There are some other options;
see man yum-verify.

==== NOTE: I could not get any of the yum/dnf verify commands to work on my rh8 system in aws. May need to revert to rpm -V.

== Installing/Removing/Upgrading Packages

Next, let's take a look at some examples of commonly performed operations.

=== Install one or more packages from repositories, resolving and installing any necessary dependencies:

`$ sudo yum install package1 [package2]`

=== Install from a local rpm:

`$ sudo yum localinstall package-file`

This is not quite the same as

`$ rpm -i package-file`

because it will attempt to resolve dependencies by accessing remote repositories.

=== Install a specific software group from a repository, resolving and installing any necessary dependencies for each package in the group:

`$ sudo yum groupinstall group-name`

or

`$ sudo yum install @group-name`

=== Remove packages from the system:

`$ sudo yum remove package1 [package2]`

You must be careful with package removal, as yum will not only remove requested packages, but all packages that depend on them!
This may not be what you want, so never run yum remove with the -y option, which assumes automatic confirmation of removal.

=== Update a package from a repository:

`$ sudo yum update [package]`

If no package name is given, all packages are updated.

During installation (or update), if a package has a configuration file which is updated, it will rename the old configuration file with an .rpmsave extension.
If the old configuration file will still work with the new software, it will name the new configuration file with an .rpmnew extension.
You can search for these filename extensions (almost always in the /etc subdirectory tree) to see if you need to do any reconciliation, by doing:

`$ sudo find /etc -name "*.rpm*"`

This is the same behavior the more naked underlying rpm utility exhibits, but we mention it here for reference.

== Additional yum Commands

There is no shortage of additional capabilities for yum, according to what plugins are installed.
You can list them all with:

`$ sudo yum list "yum-plugin*"`

=== Show a list of all enabled repositories:

`$ sudo yum repolist`

=== Initiate an interactive shell in which to run multiple YUM commands:

`$ sudo yum shell [text-file]`

If text-file is given, yum will read and execute commands from that file instead of from the terminal.

=== Download packages, but do not install them; just store them under the /var/cache/yum directory, or another directory you can specify:

`$ sudo yum install --downloadonly package`

or you can type "d" instead of "y" or "n" when prompted after issuing an install command.
The package(s) will be downloaded under /var/cache/yum in a location depending on the repository from which the download proceeds, unless the --downloaddir= option is used.
Any other necessary packages will also be downloaded to satisfy dependencies.

You can view the history of yum commands, and, with the correct options, even undo or redo previous commands:

`$ sudo yum history`

== dnf

dnf is intended to be a next generation replacement for yum, and will underlie yum in RHEL 8.

You can gradually learn to use dnf on Fedora systems because it accepts the subset of yum commands that take care of the majority of day-to-day tasks, and points out at each use of yum that has a dnf equivalent.

To learn more, see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/[Using the DNF software package manager] and https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[DNF, the next-generation replacement for yum].

== Exercise 8.1: Basic YUM Commands

. Check to see if there are any available updates for your system.
. Update a particular package.
. List all installed kernel-related packages, and list all installed or available ones.
. Install the httpd-devel package, or anything else you might not have installed yet.
Doing a simple `$ sudo yum list` will let you see a complete list;
you may want to give a wildcard argument to narrow the list.

All packages that contain a reference to bash in their name or description.
2.
Installed and available bash packages.
3.

== Exercise 8.3: Managing Groups of Packages with yum

Please Note On RHEL you may get some permission errors if you don't use sudo with some of the following commands, even when we are just getting information.

The yum/dnf command provides the ability to manage groups of packages.

. Use the following command to list all package groups available on your system: `$ yum grouplist`
. Identify the Backup Client group and generate the information about this group using the command `$ yum groupinfo "Backup Client"`
. Install using: $ sudo yum groupinstall "Backup Client"
. Identify  a  package  group  that's  currently  installed  on  your  system  and  that  you  don't  need.
Remove  it  using yum groupremove as in: `$ sudo yum groupremove "Backup Client"` Note you will be prompted to confirm removal so you can safely type the command to see how it works.
You may find that the groupremove does not remove everything that was installed;
whether this is a bug or a feature can be discussed.

== Exercise 8.4: Adding a New yum Repository

According to its authors (at http://www.webmin.com/index.htm): "`Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix.
Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and much more.
Webmin removes the need to manually edit Unix configuration files like /etc/passwd, and lets you manage a system from the console or remotely.`"

We are going to create a repository for installation and upgrade.
While we could simply go the download page and get the current rpm, that would not automatically give us any upgrades.
1.
Create a new repository file called webmin.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory.
It should contain the following: `+ webmin.repo [Webmin] name=Webmin Distribution Neutral baseurl=http://download.webmin.com/download/yum mirrorlist=http://download.webmin.com/download/yum/mirrorlist enabled=1 gpgcheck=0 +` (Note you can also cut and paste the contents from http://www.webmin.com/download.html.)

. Install the webmin package.
`$ sudo yum install webmin`
