= Chapter 16 - Linux Filesystems and the VFS

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain the basic filesystem organization.
* Understand the role of the VFS.
* Know what filesystems are available in Linux and which ones can be used on your actual system.
* Grasp why journalling filesystems represent significant advances.
* Discuss the use of special filesystems in Linux.

== Filesystem Basics

Application programs read and write files, rather than dealing with physical locations on the actual hardware on which files are stored.
Filesystems create a usable format on a physical partition.

Files and their names are an abstraction camouflaging the physical I/O layer.
Directly writing to disk from the command line (ignoring the filesystem layer) is very dangerous and is usually only done by low-level operating system software and not by user applications.
An exception is some very high-end software such as enterprise data bases that do such cmd access to skip filesystem-related latency.

A UNIX-like filesystem uses a tree hierarchy:

* Directories contain files and/or other directories
* Every path or node is under the root directory.

Multiple filesystems may be (and usually are) merged together into a single tree structure.
Linux uses a virtual filesystem layer (VFS) to communicate with the filesystem software.

Local filesystems generally reside within a disk partition which can be a physical partition on a disk, or a logical partition controlled by a Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
Filesystems can also be of a network nature and their true physical embodiment completely hidden to the local system across the network.

== Inodes

An inode is a data structure on disk that describes and stores file attributes, including location.
Every file is associated with its own inode.
The information stored in the inode includes:

* Permissions
* User and group ownership
* Size
* Timestamps (nanosecond)
 ** Last access time
 ** Last modification time
 ** Change time.

*_File names are not stored in a file's inode, but are instead stored in the directory file.
The name of a file is just a property of its inode, which is the more fundamental object._* All I/O activity concerning a file usually also involves the file's inode, as information must be updated.

== Hard and Soft Links

A directory file is a particular type of file that is used to associate file names and inodes.
There are two ways to associate (or link) a file name with an inode:

* Hard links point to an inode.
All hard linked files have to be on the same filesystem.
Changing the content of a hard linked file in one place may not change it in other places.
* Soft (or symbolic) links point to a file name which has an associated inode.
Soft linked files may be on different filesystems.
If the target does not yet exist or is not yet mounting, it can be dangling.

Each association of a directory file contents and an inode is known as a link.
Additional links can be created using ln.

Because it is possible (and quite common) for two or more directory entries to point to the same inode (hard links), a file can be known by multiple names, each of which has its own place in the directory structure.
However, it can have only one inode no matter which name is being used.

When a process refers to a pathname, the kernel searches directories to find the corresponding inode number.
After the name has been converted to an inode number, the inode is loaded into memory and is used by subsequent requests.

== Filesystem Tree Organization

All Linux systems use an inverted tree hierarchy branching off the root (/) directory.
While the entire tree may be contained in one local filesystem in one partition, usually there are multiple partitions (or network filesystems) joined together at mount points.
These can also include removable media, such as USB drives, optical drives, etc.

In addition, certain virtual pseudo filesystems (useful abstractions which exist only in memory) will be mounted within the tree;
these include /proc, /sys and /dev and perhaps /tmp and /run as well.

Each of the elements mounted within the tree may in fact have its own filesystem variety.
But, to the applications and operating system, it all appears in one unified tree structure.

== Virtual Filesystem (VFS)

Linux implements a Virtual File System (VFS), as do all modern operating systems.
When an application needs to access a file, it interacts with the VFS abstraction layer, which then translates all the I/O system calls (reading, writing etc.) into specific code relevant to the particular actual filesystem.

Thus, neither the specific actual filesystem or physical media and hardware on which it resides need be considered by applications.
Furthermore, network filesystems (such as NFS) can be handled transparently.

This permits Linux to work with more filesystem varieties than any other operating system.
This democratic attribute has been a large factor in its success.

Most filesystems have full read and write access, while a few have only read access and perhaps experimental write access.
Some filesystem types, especially non-UNIX based ones, may require more manipulation in order to be represented in the VFS.

Variants such as vfat do not have distinct read/write/execute permissions for the owner/group/world fields;
the VFS has to make an assumption about how to specify distinct permissions for the three types of user, and such behavior can be influenced by mounting operations.There are non-kernel filesystem implementations, such as the read/write ntfs-3g, which are reliable but have weaker performance than in-kernel filesystems.

== Available Filesystems

Linux supports many filesystem varieties, most with full read and write access, including:

* ext4: Linux native filesystem (and earlier ext2 and ext3)
* XFS: A high-performance filesystem originally created by SGI
* JFS: A high-performance filesystem originally created by IBM
* Windows-natives: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, VFAT, NTFS
* Pseudo-filesystems resident only in memory, including proc, sysfs, devfs, debugfs
* Network filesystems such as NFS, coda, afs
* etc.

This democratic flexibility has been a large factor in its success.
Most filesystems have full read/write access, while a few have read only access.

Commonly used filesystems include ext4, xfs, btrfs, squashfs, nfs and vfat.
A list of currently supported filesystems is at `/proc/filesystems`.

== Filesystem Varieties

You can see a list of the filesystem types currently registered and understood by the currently running Linux kernel by doing:

` $ cat /proc/filesystems iso9660 squashfs ext3 ext2 ext4 fuseblk nodev sysfs nodev proc nodev tmpfs nodev debugfs nodev sockfs nodev hugetlbfs nodev fuse nodev nfsd ` \....

The ones with nodev are special filesystems which do not reside on storage.
Additional filesystems may have their code loaded as a module only when the system tries to access a partition that uses them.

== Journaling Filesystems

Journaling filesystems recover from system crashes or ungraceful shutdowns with little or no corruption, and do so very rapidly.
While this comes at the price of having some more operations to do, additional enhancements can more than offset the price.

In a journaling filesystem, operations are grouped into transactions.
A transaction must be completed without error, atomically;
otherwise, the filesystem is not changed.
A log file is maintained of transactions.
When an error occurs, usually only the last transaction needs to be examined.

*ext3*: ext3 was an extension of the earlier non-journaling ext2 filesystem.
*ext4*: ext4 is a vastly enhanced outgrowth of ext3.
Features include extents, 48-bit block numbers, and up to 16TB size.
Most Linux distributions have used ext4 as the default filesystem for quite a few years.
*reiserfs*: reiserfs was the first journaling implementation used in Linux, but lost its leadership and further development was abandoned.
*JFS*: JFS was originally a product of IBM and was ported from IBM's AIX operating system.
*XFS*: XFS was originally a product of SGI, and was ported from SGI's IRIX operating systems.
RHEL 7 adopted XFS as its default filesystem.
*btrfs*: btrfs is the newest of the journaling filesystems and is still under rapid development.
It is the default for SUSE and openSUSE systems.

== Special Filesystems

Linux widely employs the use of special filesystems for certain tasks.
These are particularly useful for accessing various kernel data structures and tuning kernel behavior, or for implementing particular functions.
Note that some of these special filesystems have no mount point, such as sockfs or pipefs;
this means user applications don't interact with them, but the kernel uses them, taking advantage of VFS layers and code.
These special filesystems are really not true filesystems;
they are kernel facilities or subsystems that find the filesystem structural abstraction to be a useful way to recognize data and functionality.

== Exercise 16.1: The tmpfs Special Filesystem

tmpfs is one of many special filesystems used under Linux.
Some of these are not really used as filesystems, but just take advantage of the filesystem abstraction.
However, tmpfs is a real filesystem that applications can do I/O on.
Essentially, tmpfs functions as a ramdisk ; it resides purely in memory.
But it has some nice properties that old-fashioned conventional ramdisk implementations did not have:

. The filesystem adjusts its size (and thus the memory that is used) dynamically;
it starts at zero and expands as necessary up to the maximum size it was mounted with.
. If your RAM gets exhausted, tmpfs can utilize swap space.
(You still can't try to put more in the filesystem than its maximum capacity allows, however.)
. tmpfs does not require having a normal filesystem placed in it, such as ext3 or vfat;
it has its own methods for dealing with files and I/O that are aware that it is really just space in memory (it is not actually a block device), and as such are optimized for speed.
Thus there is no need to pre-format the filesystem with a mkfs command;
you merely just have to mount it and use it.

Mount a new instance of tmpfs anywhere on your directory structure with a command like:  ` $ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmpfs  $ sudo mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/tmpfs `

See how much space the filesystem has been given and how much it is using: `$ df -h /mnt/tmpfs`

` ubuntu@ip-172-31-21-230:/$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmpfs ubuntu@ip-172-31-21-230:/$ sudo mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/tmpfs ubuntu@ip-172-31-21-230:/$ df -h /mnt/tmpfs Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on none            490M     0  490M   0% /mnt/tmpfs ubuntu@ip-172-31-21-230:/$ `

You should see it has been allotted a default value of half of your RAM;
however, the usage is zero, and will only start to grow as you place files on `/mnt/tmpfs`.

You could change the allotted size as a mount option as in:  `$ sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G none /mnt/tmpfs`

You might try filling it up until you reach full capacity and see what happens.
Do not forget to unmount when you are done with:  `$ sudo umount /mnt/tmpfs`

Virtually all modern Linux distributions mount an instance of tmpfs at `/dev/shm`:  ` $ df -h /dev/shm  Filesystem Type   Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on  tmpfs      tmpfs  3.9G   24M  3.9G   1% /dev/shm `

Many applications use this such as when they are using POSIX shared memory as an inter-process communication mechanism.
Any user can create, read and write files in `/dev/shm`, so it is a good place to create temporary files in memory.
Create some files in /dev/shm and note how the filesystem is filling up with `df`.
In addition, many distributions mount multiple instances of tmpfs;
for example, on a RHEL system:  `$ df -h | grep ' tmpfs '`
