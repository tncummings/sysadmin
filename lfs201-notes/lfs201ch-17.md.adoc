Chapter 17 - Disk Partitioning

= Chapter 17 - Disk Partitioning

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Describe and contrast the most common types of hard disks and data buses.
* Explain disk geometry and other partitioning concepts.
* Understand how disk devices are named and how to identify their associated device nodes.
* Distinguish among and select different partitioning strategies.
* Use utilities such as fdisk, blkid and lsblk.
* Back up and restore partition tables.

== Common Disk Types

There are a number of different hard disk types, each of which is characterized by the type of data bus they are attached to, and other factors, such as speed, capacity, how well multiple drives work simultaneously, etc.

*SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)*: SATA disks were designed to replace the old IDE drives.
They offer a smaller cable size (7 pins), native hot swapping, and faster and more efficient data transfer.
They are seen as SCSI devices.

*SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface)*: SCSI disks range from narrow (8 bit bus) to wide (16 bit bus), with a transfer rate between 5 MB per second (narrow, standard SCSI) and 160 MB per second (Ultra-Wide SCSI-3).
Most PCs use single-ended or differential SCSI drives.
Unfortunately, the two types are not compatible with each other.
Fortunately, the two types of devices may coexist on the same controller.
Single-ended devices may host up to 7 devices, and use a maximum cable length of about 6 meters.
Differential controllers may host up to 15 devices and have a maximum cable length of about 12 meters.

*SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)*: They use a newer point-to-point protocol, and have a better performance than SATA disks.

*USB (Universal Serial Bus)*: These include flash drives and floppies.
And are seen as SCSI devices.

*SSD (Solid State Drives)*: Modern SSD drives have come down in price, have no moving parts, use less power than drives with rotational media, and have faster transfer speeds.
Internal SSDs are even installed with the same form factor and in the same enclosures as conventional drives.
SSDs still cost a bit more, but price is decreasing.
It is common to have both SSDs and rotational drives in the same machines, with frequently accessed and performance critical data transfers taking place on the SSDs.

*IDE and EIDE (Integrated Drive Electronics, Enhanced IDE)*: These are obsolete.

== Disk Geometry

Disk Geometry is a concept with a long history for rotational media;
one talks of heads, cylinders, tracks and sectors.
The below screenshot shows how to view the geometry with fdisk, which we will explore shortly:

`$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda`

Note the use of the -l option, which simply lists the partition table without entering interactive mode.

image::../../_resources/6b0423b4322743b68152e6581098eb05.png[70f0faffe7e7c3ee516b9b17fb06baed.png]

Rotational disks are composed of one or more platters, each of which is read by one more heads.
The heads read a circular track off a platter as the disk spins.

These circular tracks are divided into data blocks called sectors, typically 512 bytes in size.
A cylinder is a group which consists of the same track on all platters.

The physical structural image has been less and less relevant as internal electronics on the drive actually obscure much of it.
Furthermore, SSDs have no moving parts or anything like the above ingredients.

Currently, disks are starting to be manufactured with sectors larger than 512 bytes;
4 KB is becoming available.
While larger sector sizes can lead to faster transfer speeds, operating system support is not yet mature in dealing with the larger sizes.

== Partition Organization

Disks are divided into partitions.
In geometrical terms, these consist of physically contiguous groups of sectors or cylinders.
A partition is a physically contiguous region on the disk.
There are two partitioning layouts in use:

* MBR (Master Boot Record)
* GPT (GUID Partition Table)

MBR dates back to the early days of MSDOS.
When using MBR, a disk may have up to four primary partitions.
One of the primary partitions can be designated as an extended partition, which can be subdivided further into logical partitions with 15 partitions possible.

When using the MBR scheme, if we have a SCSI, for example, `/dev/sda`, then `/dev/sda1` is the first primary partition and `/dev/sda2` is the second primary partition.
If we created an extended partition `/dev/sda3`, it could be divided into logical partitions.
All partitions greater than four are logical partitions (meaning contained within an extended partition).
There can only be one extended partition, but it can be divided into numerous logical partitions.

*_Linux doesn't require partitions to begin or end on cylinder boundaries, but other operating systems might complain if they don't.
For this reason, the widely deployed Linux partitioning utilities try to play nice and end on boundaries.
Obviously, partitions should not overlap either._*

GPT is on all modern systems and is based on UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).
By default, it may have up to 128 primary partitions.
When using the GPT scheme, there is no need for extended partitions.
Partitions can be up to 233 TB in size (with MBR, the limit is just 2TB).

== Why Partition?

There are multiple reasons as to why it makes sense to divide your system data into multiple partitions, including:

* Separation of user and application data from operating system files
* Sharing between operating systems and/or machines
* Security enhancement by imposing different quotas and permissions for different system parts
* Size concerns;
keeping variable and volatile storage isolated from stable
* Performance enhancement of putting most frequently used data on faster storage media
* Swap space can be isolated from data and also used for hibernation storage.

Deciding what to partition and how to separate your partitions is cause for thought.
The reasons to have distinct partitions include increased granularity of security, quota, settings or size restrictions.
You could have distinct partitions to allow for data protection.

A common partition layout contains a boot partition, a partition for the root filesystem `/`, a swap partition, and a partition for the `/home` directory tree.

Keep in mind that it is more difficult to resize a partition after the fact than during install/creation time.
Plan accordingly.

== MBR Partition Table

The disk partition table is contained within the disk's Master Boot Record (MBR), and is the 64 bytes following the 446 byte boot record.
One partition on a disk may be marked active.
When the system boots, that partition is where the MBR looks for items to load.

Remember that there can be only one extended partition, but that partition may contain a number of logical partitions.

The structure of the MBR is defined by an operating system-independent convention.
The first 446 bytes are reserved for the program code.
They typically hold part of a boot loader program.
The next 64 bytes provide space for a partition table of up to four entries.
The operating system needs this table for handling the hard disk.

On Linux systems, the beginning and ending address in CHS is ignored.

Note for the curious, there are 2 more bytes at the end of the MBR known as the magic number, signature word, or end of sector marker, which always have the value 0x55AA.

image::../../_resources/0bd28bfc97504e0bb9321c730451c14f.png[067f04df2318258901b35c3d34a04774.png]

=== MBR Disk Partition Table

Each entry in the partition table is 16 bytes long, and describes one of the four possible primary partitions.
The information for each is:

* Active bit
* Beginning address in cylinder/head/sectors (CHS) format (ignored by Linux)
* Partition type code, indicating: xfs, LVM, ntfs, ext4, swap, etc.
* Ending address in CHS (also ignored by Linux)
* Start sector, counting linearly from 0
* Number of sectors in partition.

Linux only uses the last two fields for addressing, using the linear block addressing (LBA) method.

== GPT Partition Table

Modern hardware comes with GPT support;
MBR support will gradually fade away.

The Protective MBR is for backwards compatibility, so UEFI systems can be booted the old way.

There are two copies of the GPT header, at the beginning and at the end of the disk, describing metadata:

* List of usable blocks on disk
* Number of partitions
* Size of partition entries.
Each partition entry has a minimum size of 128 bytes.

GPT Layout

=== GPT Disk Partition Table

The blkid utility (to be discussed later) shows information about partitions.

On a modern UEFI/GPT system:

` ROOT@x7:/root>blkid /dev/sda6 /dev/sda6: LABEL="CENTOS7" UUID="77461ee7-c34a-4c5f-b0bc-29f4feecc743" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="1f361af4-81e6-4a81-82 ROOT@x7:/root> `

On a legacy MBR system:

` c7:/teaching/LFCW/LFS301>sudo blkid /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb1: LABEL="RHEL7" UUID="471dfeba-3ec7-4529-8069-2afe50762c57" TYPE="ext4" `

Note both examples give a unique UUID, which describes the filesystem on the partition, not the partition itself.
It changes if the filesystem is reformatted.

The GPT partition also gives a PARTUUID which describes the partition and stays the same even if the filesystem is reformatted.
If the hardware supports it, it is possible to migrate an MBR system to GPT, but it is not hard to brick the machine while doing so.Thus, usually the benefits are not worth the risk.

== Naming Disk Devices and Device Nodes

The Linux kernel interacts at a low level with disks through device nodes normally found in the /dev directory.
Normally, device nodes are accessed only through the infrastructure of the kernel's Virtual File System;
raw access through the device nodes is an extremely efficient way to destroy a filesystem.
For example, you do this when formatting a partition, as in:

`$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda9`

Device nodes for SCSI and SATA disks follow a simple xxy[z] naming convention, where xx is the device type (usually sd), y is the letter for the drive number (a, b, c, etc.), and z is the partition number:

* The first hard disk is `/dev/sda`
* The second hard disk is `/dev/sdb`
* Etc.

Partitions are also easily enumerated, as in:

* `/dev/sdb1` is the first partition on the second disk
* `/dev/sdc4` is the fourth partition on the third disk.

In the above, sd means SCSI or SATA disk.
Back in the days where IDE disks could be found, they would have been /dev/hda3, /dev/hdb etc.

Doing `ls -l /dev` will show you the current available disk device nodes.

== More on SCSI Device Names

For SCSI devices, we need to elaborate a little more on what we mean by first, second hard disk, etc.
*These are determined by the controller number/ID number combination.*

The drive designation (a, b, c, etc.) *is primarily based on the ID number of the SCSI device, rather than its position on the bus itself.*

For example, if we had two SCSI controllers with target ID number 1 and 3 on controller 0, and target ID number 2 and 5 on controller 1 (with ID 2 as the last drive):

* ID 1 would be `/dev/sda`
* ID 3 would be `/dev/sdb`
* ID 2 (on controller 1) would be `/dev/sdc`
* ID 5 would be `/dev/sdd`

== blkid

`blkid` is a utility to locate block devices and report on their attributes.
It works with the libblkid library.
It can take as an argument a particular device or list of devices.
The screenshot below shows a use of blkid with arguments:

`$ sudo blkid /dev/sda*`

Screenshot of the sudo blkid /dev/sda* command and its output image:../../_resources/ecee01939ced44d8ba49448bb36127cb.png[aa6e483db43d94c3fc46d10cdd6fe86a.png]

=== Using blkid

It can determine the type of content (e.g.
filesystem, swap) a block device holds, and also attributes (tokens, NAME=value pairs) from the content metadata (e.g., LABEL or UUID fields).

blkid will only work on devices which contain data that is finger-printable: e.g., an empty partition will not generate a block-identifying UUID.
blkid has two main forms of operation: either searching for a device with a specific NAME=value pair, or displaying NAME=value pairs for one or more devices.
Without arguments, it will report on all devices.
There are quite a few options designating how to specify devices and what attributes to report on.
Other sample commands:

`$ sudo blkid`

`$ sudo blkid -L root`

== lsblk

A related utility is lsblk which presents block device information in a tree format, as in the following screenshot.

image::../../_resources/f86f0c91b2a2466ab3026e8596017a63.png[0f23e696d2fc67cc426fc71b0ab0dc30.png]

== Sizing Up Partitions

Most Linux systems should use a minimum of two partitions.

*/(root)*: This is used for the entire logical filesystem - In practice, most installations will have more than one filesystem on more than one partition, which are joined together at mount points.
- It is difficult with most filesystem types to resize the root partition;
using LVM, which we will discuss later, can make this easier.
While it is certainly possible to run Linux with just the root partition, most systems use more partitions to allow for easier backups, more efficient use of disk drives, and better security.

*swap*: Swap is used as an extension of physical memory;
pages of memory which are not file-backed can be moved to disk until needed again.

The usual recommendation is swap size should be equal to physical memory in size;
sometimes, twice that is recommended.
However, the correct choice depends on the related issues of system use scenarios, as well as hardware capabilities.
Examples of thinking on this subject can be found at the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq[SwapFaq web page] and in the https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7010157[Is a swap partition required for SLES?] document.

The system may have multiple swap partitions and/or swap files.

On a single disk system, try to center the swap partition;
on multiple disk systems, try to spread swap over disks.

Adding more and more swap will not necessarily help because, at a certain point, it becomes useless.
You will need to either add more memory or re-evaluate the system setup.

== Backing Up and Restoring Partition Tables

Partitioning and re-partitioning disks are dangerous operations.
In order to be able to restore the situation if something goes wrong, you need to know how to back up and restore partition tables.

Backing up can be easily done with dd, as in:

`$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbrbackup bs=512 count=1`

which will back up the MBR on the first disk, including the 64-bit partition table which is part of it.

The MBR can then be restored, if necessary, by doing:

`$ sudo dd if=mbrbackup of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1`

Note that the above commands only copy the primary partition table;
they do not deal with any partition tables stored in the other partitions (for extended partitions, etc.)

*_You should always assume that changing the disk partition table might eliminate all data in all filesystems on the disk (It should not, but be cautious!).
Therefore, it is always prudent to make a backup of all data (that is not already backed up) before doing any of this type of work._*

In particular, you must be careful in using dd: a simple typing error or misused option could destroy your entire disk;
hence, do backups!

For GPT systems, it is best to use the sgdisk tool, as in:

``` x7:/tmp>sudo sgdisk --backup=/tmp/sda_backup /dev/sda The operation has completed successfully.

x7:/tmp>sudo file sda_backup sda_backup: x86 boot sector;
partition 1: ID=0xee, starthead 0, startsector 1, 1000215215 sectors, extended partition table (last)\011, code offset 0x63

Note if run on a pure MBR system:

c7:/tmp>sudo sgdisk --backup=/tmp/sda_backup /dev/sda `+***************************************************************+` Found invalid GPT and valid MBR;
converting MBR to GPT format in memory.
`+***************************************************************+` The operation has completed successfully.

c7:/tmp>file /tmp/sda_backup /tmp/sda_backup: x86 boot sector;
partition 1: ID=0xee, starthead 0, startsector 1, 3907029167 sectors, code offset 0xb8 ```

== Partition Table Editors

There are a number of utilities which can be used to manage partition tables.

*fdisk*: fdisk is a menu-driven partition table editor.
It is the most standard and one of the most flexible of the partition table editors.
As with any other partition table editor, make sure that you either write down the current partition table settings or make a copy of the current settings before making changes.

*sfdisk*: sfdisk is a non-interactive Linux-based partition editor program, making it useful for scripting.
Use the sfdisk tool with care!

*parted*: parted is the GNU partition manipulation program.
It can create, remove, resize, and move partitions (including certain filesystems).
The GUI interface to the parted command is gparted.

*gparted*: gparted is a widely-used graphical interface to parted.

*gdisk*: gdisk is used for GPT systems, but can also operate on MBR systems.

*sgdisk*: sgdisk is a script or command line interface.

Many Linux distributions have a live/installation version which can be run off either a CDROM or USB stick.
These media usually include a copy of gparted, so they can easily be used as a graphical partitioning tool on disks which are not actually being used while the partitioning program is run.

== Using fdisk

fdisk will always be included in any Linux installation, so it is a good idea to learn how to use it.
You must be root to run fdisk.
It can be somewhat complex to handle, and caution is advised.

The fdisk interface is simple and text-menu driven.
After starting on a particular disk, as in: `$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb`

the main (one letter) commands are:

 m: Display the menu
 p: List the partition table
 n: Create a new partition
 d: Delete a partition
 t: Change a partition type
 w: Write the new partition table information and exit
 q: Quit without making changes.

Fortunately, no actual changes are made until you write the partition table to the disk by entering w.
It is therefore important to verify your partition table is correct (with p) before writing to disk with w.
If something is wrong, you can jump out safely with q.

The system will not use the new partition table until you reboot.
However, you can use the following command:

`$ sudo partprobe -s`

to try and read in the revised partition table.
However, this doesn't always work reliably and it is best to reboot before doing things like formatting new partitions, etc., as mixing up partitions can be catastrophic.

At any time you can do:

`$ cat /proc/partitions`

to examine what partitions the operating system is currently aware of.

== Lab 17.1. Using a File as a Disk Partition Image

In this first exercise, we are going to create a file that will be used as a container for a full hard disk partition image, and for all intents and purposes can be used like a real hard partition.
In the following exercise, we will show how to put more than one partition on it and have it behave as an entire disk.

. Create a file full of zeros 1 GB in length: `$ dd if=/dev/zero of=imagefile bs=1M count=1024` You can make a much smaller file if you like or do not have that much available space in the partition you are creating the file on.
. Put a filesystem on it: `$ mkfs.ext4 imagefile` ` mke2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013) imagefile is not a block special device.
Proceed anyway?
(y,n) y Discarding device blocks: done ` \.....
Of course you can format with a different filesystem, doing `mkfs.ext3, mkfs.vfat, mkfs.xfs, etc.`
. Mount it somewhere: `$ mkdir mntpoint` `$ sudo mount -o loop imagefile mntpoint` You can now use this to your heart's content, putting files etc.
on it.
. When you are done unmount it with: `$ sudo umount mntpoint`

An alternative method to using the loop option to mount would be: `$ sudo losetup /dev/loop2 imagefile` `$ sudo mount /dev/loop2 mntpoint` \....
`$ sudo umount mntpoint` `$ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop2`

We will discuss losetup in a subsequent exercise, and you can use `/dev/loop[0-7]` but you have to be careful they are not already in use, as we will explain.
You should note that using a loop device file instead of a real partition can be useful, but it is pretty worthless for doing any kind of measurements or benchmarking.
This is because you are placing one filesystem layer on top of another, which can only have a negative effect on performance, and mostly you just use the behavior of the underlying filesystem the image file is created on.

== Lab 17.2. Partitioning a Disk Image File

The next level of complication is to divide the container file into multiple partitions, each of which can be used to hold a filesystem, or a swap area.
You can reuse the image file created in the previous exercise or create a new one.

. Run fdisk on your imagefile: `$ sudo fdisk -C 130 imagefile` ``` Device does not contain a recognized partition table Building a new DOS disk label with disk identifier 0x6280ced3.
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.23.2).

Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.

Be careful before using the write command.
Command (m for help): ``` The `-C 130` sets the number of phony cylinders in the drive,  and is only necessary in old versions of fdisk, which unfortunately you will find on RHEL 6.
However, it will do no harm on other distributions.

. Type m to get a list of commands: ` m Command (m for help): m Command action a   toggle a bootable flag b   edit bsd disklabel c   toggle the dos compatibility flag d   delete a partition g   create a new empty GPT partition table G   create an IRIX (SGI) partition table l   list known partition types m   print this menu n   add a new partition o   create a new empty DOS partition table p   print the partition table q   quit without saving changes s   create a new empty Sun disklabel t   change a partition's system id u   change display/entry units v   verify the partition table w   write table to disk and exit x   extra functionality (experts only) Command (m for help): `
. Create a new primary partition and make it 256 MB (or whatever size you would like:

` Command (m for help): n Partition type: p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free) e   extended Select (default p): p Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1 First sector (2048-2097151, default 2048): Using default value 2048 Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-2097151, default 2097151): +256M Partition 1 of type Linux and of size 256 MiB is set `

. Add a second primary partition also of 256 MB in size:

` Command (m for help): n Partition type: p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free) e   extended Select (default p): p Partition number (2-4, default 2): 2 First sector (526336-2097151, default 526336): Using default value 526336 Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (526336-2097151, default 2097151): +256M Partition 2 of type Linux and of size 256 MiB is set Command (m for help): p Disk imagefile: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes, 2097152 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk label type: dos Disk identifier: 0x6280ced3 Device Boot      StartEnd      Blocks   Id  System imagefile1          2048      526335      262144   83  Linux imagefile2          526336     1050623      262144   83  Linux `

. Write the partition table to disk and exit: ` Command (m for help): w The partition table has been altered!
Syncing disks.
`

While this has given us some good practice, we haven't yet seen a way to use the two partitions we just created.
We'll start over in the next exercise with a method that lets us do so.

== Lab 17.3. Using losetup and parted

We are going to experiment more with: - Loop devices and losetup - parted to partition at the command line non-interactively.
-  We expect that you should read the man pages for `losetup` and `parted` before doing the following procedures.
Once again, you can reuse the image file or, better still, zero it out and start freshly or with another file.

. Associate the image file with a loop device: `$ sudo losetup -f` `/dev/loop1` `$ sudo losetup /dev/loop1 imagefile`

where the first command finds the first free loop device.
The reason to do this is you may already be using one or more loop devices.
For example, on the system that this is being written on, before the above command is executed: `$ losetup -a` `/dev/loop0: []: (/usr/src/KERNELS.sqfs)`

a squashfs compressed, read-only filesystem is already mounted using `/dev/loop0`.
(The output of this command will vary with distribution.) If we were to ignore this and use losetup on /dev/loop0 we would almost definitely corrupt the file.

. Create a disk partition label on the loop device (image file): $ sudo parted -s /dev/loop1 mklabel msdos
. Create three primary partitions on the loop device: ` $ sudo parted -s /dev/loop1 unit MB mkpart primary ext4 0 256 $ sudo parted -s /dev/loop1 unit MB mkpart primary ext4 256 512 $ sudo parted -s /dev/loop1 unit MB mkpart primary ext4 512 1024 `
. Check the partition table: `$ fdisk -l /dev/loop1` ` Disk /dev/loop1: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes, 2097152 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk label type: dos Disk identifier: 0x00050c11 Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System /dev/loop1p1               1      500000      250000   83  Linux /dev/loop1p2          500001     1000000      250000   83  Linux /dev/loop1p3         1000001     2000000      500000   83  Linux `
. What happens next depends on what distribution you are on.
For example, on RHEL and Ubuntu you will find new device nodes have been created: ` $ ls -l /dev/loop1* brw-rw---- 1 root disk   7, 1 Oct  7 14:54 /dev/loop1 brw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 0 Oct  7 14:54 /dev/loop1p1 brw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 3 Oct  7 14:54 /dev/loop1p2 brw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 4 Oct  7 14:54 /dev/loop1p3 `
. Put filesystems on the partitions: `$ sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/loop1p1` `$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop1p2` `$ sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/loop1p3`
. Mount all three filesystems and show they are available: `$ mkdir mnt1 mnt2 mnt3` `$ sudo mount /dev/loop1p1 mnt1` `$ sudo mount /dev/loop1p2 mnt2` `$ sudo mount /dev/loop1p3 mnt3` `+ $ df -Th Filesystem                Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1                 ext4       29G  8.5G   19G  32% / ....
/dev/loop1p1              ext3      233M  2.1M  219M   1% mnt1 /dev/loop1p2              ext4      233M  2.1M  215M   1% mnt2 /dev/loop1p3              vfat      489M     0  489M   0% mnt3 8 +`
. After using the filesystems to your heart's content you can unwind it all: `$ sudo umount mnt1 mnt2 mnt3` `$ rmdir mnt1 mnt2 mnt3` `$ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop1`
