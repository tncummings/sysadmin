* Display logical volumes.
* Resize logical volumes.
* Use LVM snapshots.

== Logical Volume Management (LVM)

LVM (Logical Volume Management) breaks up one virtual partition into multiple chunks, each of which can be on different partitions and/or disks.

There are many advantages to using LVM;
in particular, it becomes really easy to change the size of the logical partitions and filesystems, to add more storage space, rearrange things, etc.

One or more physical volumes (disk partitions) are grouped together into a volume group.
Then, the volume group is subdivided into logical volumes, which mimic to the system nominal physical disk partitions and can be formatted to contain mountable filesystems.

There are a variety of command line utilities tasked to create, delete, resize, etc.
physical and logical volumes.
For a graphical tool, some Linux distributions use system-config-lvm.
However, RHEL no longer supports this tool and there is currently no graphical tool that works reliably with the most recent variations in filesystem types etc.
Fortunately, the command line utilities are not hard to use and are more flexible anyway.

LVM does impact performance.
There is a definite additional cost that comes from the overhead of the LVM layer.
However, even on non-RAID systems, if you use striping (splitting of data to more than one disk), you can achieve some parallelization improvements.

Like RAID (which we will discuss in the next chapter), the use of logical volumes is a mechanism for creating filesystems which can span more than one physical disk.

Logical volumes are created by putting all the devices into a large pool of disk space (the volume group), and then allocating space from the pool to create a logical volume.

Logical volumes have features similar to RAID devices.
They can actually be built on top of a RAID device.
This would give the logical volume the redundancy of a RAID device with the scalability of LVM.

LVM has better scalability than RAID: logical volumes can easily be resized;
i.e., enlarged or shrunk, as needs require.
If more space is needed, additional devices can be added to the logical volume at any time.

== Volumes and Volume Groups

Partitions are converted to physical volumes and multiple physical volumes are grouped into volume groups;
there can be more than one volume group on the system.

Space in the volume group is divided into extents;
these are 4 MB in size by default, but the size can easily be changed when being allocated.

Logical volumes are allocated from volume groups:

* Can be defined by the size or number of extents
* Filesystems are built on logical volumes
* Can be named anything.

There are a number of command line utilities used to create and manipulate volume groups, whose name always start with vg, including:

* *`vgcreate`*: Creates volume groups.
* *`vgextend`*: Adds to volume groups.
* *`vgreduce`*: Shrinks volume groups.

Utilities that manipulate what physical partitions enter or leave volume groups start with pv and include:

* *`pvcreate`*: Converts a partition to a physical volume.
* *`pvdisplay`*: Shows the physical volumes being used.
* *`pvmove`*: Moves the data from one physical volume within the volume group to others;
this might be required if a disk or partition is being removed for some reason.
It would then be followed by:
* *`pvremove`*: Remove a partition from a physical volume.

Typing `man lvm` will give a full list of LVM utilities.

== Logical Volumes Utilities

There are a number of utilities that manipulate logical volumes.
Unsurprisingly, they all begin with lv.
We will discuss the most commonly used ones, but a short list can be obtained, using the following command, as in the screenshot:

$ ls -lF /sbin/lv* image:../../_resources/d9e5d0625ddb48dab6bc0705b990fdb6.png[dbac178fd6d53cac2f474f56b90f863e.png]

These utilities are in `/sbin`, not in `/usr/sbin`, as they may be needed either for boot or repair and recovery.

Most of them are symbolically linked to `lvm`, a Swiss army knife program that does all the work, but figures out what is being asked to do based on the name it is invoked with.
This is also true for most of the pv* and vg* utilities, as you can verify easily enough.

== Creating Logical Volumes

lvcreate allocates logical volumes from within volume groups.
The size can be specified either in bytes or number of extents (remember, they are 4 MB by default).
Names can be anything desired.

`lvdisplay` reports on available logical volumes.

Filesystems are placed in logical volumes and are formatted with mkfs, as usual.

Starting with possibly creating a new volume group, the steps involved in setting up and using a new logical volume are:

. Create partitions on disk drives (type 8e in fdisk).
. Create physical volumes from the partitions.
. Create the volume group.
. Allocate logical volumes from the volume group.
. Format the logical volumes.
. Mount the logical volumes (also update /etc/fstab as needed).

For example, assuming you have already created partitions /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 and given them type 8e:

`$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1` `$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc1` `$ sudo vgcreate -s 16M vg /dev/sdb1` `$ sudo vgextend vg /dev/sdc1` `$ sudo lvcreate -L 50G -n mylvm vg` `$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg/mylvm` `$ sudo mkdir /mylvm` `$ sudo mount /dev/vg/mylvm /mylvm`

Be sure to add the line:

`/dev/vg/mylvm /mylvm ext4 defaults 1 2`

to `/etc/fstab` to make this a persistent mount.

== Displaying Logical Volumes

In order to display information about LVM, there are several command line programs available.

*`pvdisplay`* shows physical volumes.
If you leave off the physical volume name, it lists all physical volumes:

`$ pvdisplay` `$ pvdisplay /dev/sda5`

*`vgdisplay`* shows volume groups.
If you leave off the volume group name, it lists all volume groups:

`$ vgdisplay` `$ vgdisplay /dev/vg0`

*`lvdisplay`* shows logical volumes.
If you leave off the logical volume name, it lists all logical volumes:

`$ lvdisplay` `$ lvdisplay /dev/vg0/lvm1`

Without arguments, these utilities will display all physical volumes, volume groups, or logical volumes.

== Resizing Logical Volumes

One great advantage of using LVM is that it is easy and quick to change the size of a logical volume, especially when compared with trying to do this with a physical partition that already contains a filesystem.
When doing this, extents can be added or subtracted from the logical volume, and they can come from anywhere in the volume group;
they need not be from physically contiguous sections of the disk.

If the volume contains a filesystem, expanding or shrinking it is an entirely different operation than changing the size of the volume.
When expanding a logical volume with a filesystem, you must first expand the volume, and then expand the filesystem.
When shrinking a logical volume with a filesystem, you must first shrink the filesystem, and then shrink the volume.

This is best done with lvresize, as in:

`$ sudo lvresize -r -L 20 GB /dev/VG/mylvm`

where the -r option causes resizing of the filesystem at the same time as the volume size is changed.

You can also reduce a volume group as in:

`$ sudo pvmove /dev/sdc1` `$ sudo vgreduce vg /dev/sdc1`

The filesystem cannot be mounted when being shrunk.
However, some filesystems permit expansion while they are mounted.

The utilities which change the filesystem size are obviously filesystem dependent;
besides `lvresize`, we can also use `lvextend`, `lvreduce` with `resize2fs`.

== LVM Snapshots

LVM snapshots create an exact copy of an existing logical volume.
They are useful for backups, application testing, and deploying VMs (Virtual Machines).
The original state of the snapshot is kept as the block map.

Snapshots only use space for storing deltas:

* When the original logical volume changes, original data blocks are copied to the snapshot.
* If data is added to snapshot, it is stored only there.

To create a snapshot of an existing logical volume:

`$ sudo lvcreate -l 128 -s -n mysnap /dev/vg/mylvm`

To then make a mount point and mount the snapshot:

`$ mkdir /mysnap` `$ mount -o ro /dev/vg/mysnap /mysnap`

To use the snapshot and to remove the snapshot:

`$ sudo umount /mysnap` `$ sudo lvremove /dev/vg/mysnap`

Always be sure to remove the snapshot when you are through with it.
If you do not remove the snapshot and it fills up because of changes, it will be automatically disabled.
A snapshot with the size of the original will never overflow.

== Lab 23.1: Logical Volumes

We are going to create a logical volume using two 250 MB partitions.
We are going to assume you have real partitionable disk space available.
1.
Create two 250 MB partitions of type logical volume (8e).
2.
Convert the partitions to physical volumes.
3.
Create a volume group named myvg and add the two physical volumes to it.
Use the default extent size.
4.
Allocate a 300 MB logical volume named mylvm from volume group myvg.
5.
Format and mount the logical volume mylvm at `/mylvm`.
6.
Use `lvdisplay` to view information about the logical volume.
7.
Grow the logical volume and corresponding filesystem to 350 MB.

=== Solution

`$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda` using whatever hard disk is appropriate, and create the two partitions.
While in fdisk, typing t will let you set the partition type to 8e.
While it doesn't matter if you don't set the type, it is a good idea to lessen confusion.
Use w to rewrite the partition table and exit, and then:

`$ sudo partprobe -s` or reboot to make sure the new partitions take effect.

Assuming the new partitions are `/dev/sdaX` and `/dev/sdaY`: `$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdaX` `$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdaY` `$ sudo pvdisplay`

`$ sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/sdaX /dev/sdaY` `$ sudo vgdisplay`

`$ sudo lvcreate -L 300M -n mylvm myvg` `$ sudo lvdisplay`

`$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylvm` `$ sudo mkdir /mylvm` `$ sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylvm /mylvm` If you want the mount to be persistent, edit `/etc/fstab` to include the line: `/dev/myvg/mylvm /mylvm ext4 defaults 0 0`

`$ sudo lvdisplay` `$ df -h` `$ sudo lvresize -r -L 350M /dev/myvg/mylvm` `$ df -h` or `$ sudo lvresize -r -L +50M /dev/myvg/mylvm`

or with older methods you can do:

`$ df -h` `$ sudo lvextend -L 350M /dev/myvg/mylvm` `$ sudo resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylvm` `$ df -h`
