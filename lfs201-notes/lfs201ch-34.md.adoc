Chapter 34 - Network Addresses

= Chapter 34 - Network Addresses

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Differentiate between different types of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* Understand the role of netmasks.
* Get, set, and change the hostname, based on the system you are using.

== IP Addresses

IP addresses are used to uniquely identify nodes across the internet.
They are registered through ISPs (Internet Service Providers).

The IP address is the number that identifies your system on the network.
It comes in two varieties.

*_IPv4_*: IPv4 is a 32-bit address, composed of 4 octets (an octet is just 8 bits, or a byte).
Example: 148.114.252.10

*_IPv6_*: IPv6 is a 128-bit address, composed of 8 16-bit octet pairs.Example: 2003:0db5:6123:0000:1f4f:0000:5529:fe23

In either case, a set of reserved addresses is also included.
We will focus somewhat more on IPv4, as it is still what is most commonly in use.

== IPv4 Address Types

*_Unicast_*: An address associated with a specific host.
It might be something like 140.211.169.4 or 64.254.248.193.

*_Network_*: An address whose host portion is set to all binary zeroes.
Ex.
192.168.1.0.
(the host portion can be the last 1-3 octets as discussed later;
here it is just the last octet).

*_Broadcast_*: An address to which each member of a particular network will listen.
It will have the host portion set to all 1 bits, such as in 172.16.255.255 or 148.114.255.255 or 192.168.1.255.
(the host portion is the last two octets in the first two cases, just the last one in the third case).

*_Multicast_*: An address to which appropriately configured nodes will listen.
The address 224.0.0.2 is an example of a multicast address.
Only nodes specifically configured to pay attention to a specific multicast address will interpret packets for that multicast group.

== Reserved Addresses

Certain addresses and address ranges are reserved for special purposes.

=== Examples of Reserved Addresses

*_127.x.x.x_*: Reserved for the loopback (local system) interface, where 0 \<= x \<= 254.
Generally, 127.0.0.1.

*_0.0.0.0_*: Used by systems that do not yet know their own address.
Protocols like DHCP and BOOTP use this address when attempting to communicate with a server.

*_255.255.255.255_*: Generic broadcast private address, reserved for internal use.
These addresses are never assigned or registered to anyone.
They are generally not routable.

=== Other reserved addresses

Other examples of reserved address ranges include:

* *_10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255_*
* *_172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255_*
* *_192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255_*
* etc.

Each of these has a purpose.
For example, the familiar address range, 192.168.x.x is used only for local communications within a private network.

You can see a long list of reserved addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6 on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses[Reserved IP addresses Wikipedia page].

== IPv6 Address Types

*_Unicast_*: A packet is delivered to one interface.

* Link-local: Auto-configured for every interface to have one.
Non-routable.
* Global: Dynamically or manually assigned.
Routable.
* Reserved for documentation.

*_Multicast_*: A packet is delivered to multiple interfaces.

*_Anycast_*: A packet is delivered to the nearest of multiple interfaces (in terms of routing distance).

*_IPv4-mapped_*: An IPv4 address mapped to IPv6.
For example, ::FFFF:a.b.c.d/96

In addition, IPv6 has some special types of addresses such as loopback, which is assigned to the lo interface, as ::1/128.

== IPv4 Address Classes

Historically, IP addresses are based on defined classes.
Classes A, B, and C are used to distinguish a network portion of the address from a host portion of the address.
This is used for routing purposes.

Class A addresses use 8 bits for the network portion of the address and 24 bits for the host portion of the address.
Class B addresses use 16 and 16 bits respectively, while Class C addresses use 24 bits for the network portion and 8 bits for the host portion.

Class D addresses are used for multicasting.
Class E addresses are currently not used.

== Netmasks

netmask is used to determine how much of the address is used for the network portion and how much for the host portion as we have seen.
It is also used to determine network and broadcast addresses.

The network address is obtained by anding (logical and - &) the IP address with the netmask.
We are interested in the network addresses because they define a local network which consists of a collection of nodes connected via the same media and sharing the same network address.
All nodes on the same network can directly see each other.

Example: ` 172.16.2.17 ip address &255.255.0.0 netmask ----------------- 172.16.0.0 network address `

== Getting and Setting the Hostname

The hostname is simply a label to distinguish a networked device from other nodes.
Historically, this has also been called a nodename.

For DNS purposes, hostnames are appended with a period (dot) and a domain name, so that a machine with a hostname of antje could have a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of antje.linuxfoundation.org.

The hostname is generally specified at installation time, and can be modified at any time later.

At any given time ascertaining the current hostname is as simple as:

` $ hostname wally `

Changing hostname requires root privilege:

` $ sudo hostname lumpy lumpy `

To do this persistently so changes survive a reboot use hostnamectl, part of the systemd infrastructure:

`$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname lumpy`

Historically, making persistent changes involved changing configuration files in the etc directory tree.
On Red Hat-based systems this was `/etc/sysconfig/network`, on Debian-based systems this was `/etc/hostname` and on SUSE-based systems it was `/etc/HOSTNAME`.
However, one should use `hostnamectl` on modern systems:

` $ hostnamectl    Static hostname: c8          Icon name: computer-desktop            Chassis: desktop         Machine ID: ce0c82382a8a4c80bbd6931a917a2f1c            Boot ID: 94207b3fbd9b4891b9a94e21762a47cb   Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 (Ootpa) \            dracut-049-70.git20200228.el8 (Initramfs)             Kernel: Linux 5.11.6       Architecture: x86-64 `

To see a usage message:

``` $ hostnamectl --help hostnamectl [OPTIONS\...] COMMAND \...

Query or change system hostname

-h --help              Show this help    --version           Show package version    --no-ask-password   Do not prompt for password -H --host=[USER@]HOST  Operate on remote host -M --machine=CONTAINER Operate on local container    --transient         Only set transient hostname    --static            Only set static hostname    --pretty            Only set pretty hostname

Commands:   status               Show current hostname settings   set-hostname NAME    Set system hostname   set-icon-name NAME   Set icon name for host   set-chassis NAME     Set chassis type for host   set-deployment NAME  Set deployment environment for host   set-location NAME    Set location for host ```
