Chapter 19: Filesystem Features: Swap, Quotas, Usage

= Filesystem Features: Swap, Quotas, Usage

== Chapter 19 Introduction

Linux uses a robust swap space implementation through which the virtual memory system permits the apparent use of more memory than is physically available.
Filesystem quotas can be used to administer user account usage of disk space.
Utilities such as df and du enable easy monitoring of filesystem usage and capacities.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain the concepts of swap and quotas.
* Use the utilities that help manage quotas: quotacheck, quotaon, quotaoff, edquota, and quota.
* Use the utilities df and du.

== Using swap

Linux employs a virtual memory system, in which the operating system can function as if it had more memory than it really does.
This kind of memory overcommission functions in two ways:

* Many programs do not actually use all the memory they are given permission to use.
Sometimes, this is because child processes inherit a copy of the parent's memory regions utilizing a COW (Copy On Write) technique, in which the child only obtains a unique copy (on a page-by-page basis) when there is a change.
* When memory pressure becomes important, less active memory regions may be swapped out to disk, to be recalled only when needed again.

Such swapping is usually done to one or more dedicated partitions or files;
Linux permits multiple swap areas, so the needs can be adjusted dynamically.
Each area has a priority, and lower priority areas are not used until higher priority areas are filled.

In most situations, the recommended swap size is the total RAM on the system.
You can see what your system is currently using for swap areas by looking at `/proc/swaps` and getting basic memory statistics with free:

`$ cat /proc/swaps` ` Filename Type Size Used Priority /dev/sda6 partition 8290300 0 -1 /tmp/swpfile file 102396 0 -2 `

`$ free -m`

The only commands involving swap are:

* `mkswap`: format a swap partition or file
* `swapon`: activate a swap partition or file
* `swapoff`: deactivate a swap partition or file.

At any given time, most memory is in use for caching file contents to prevent actually going to the disk any more than necessary, or in a sub-optimal order or timing.
Such pages of memory are never swapped out as the backing store is the files themselves, so writing out a swap would be pointless;
instead, dirty pages (memory containing updated file contents that no longer reflect the stored data) are flushed out to disk.

It is also worth pointing out that in *_Linux memory used by the kernel itself, as opposed to application memory, is never swapped out, in distinction to some other operating systems._*

== Filesystem Quotas

Linux can use and enforce quotas on filesystems.
Disk quotas allow administrators to control the maximum space particular users (or groups) are allowed.
Considerable flexibility is allowed and quotas can be assigned on a per filesystem basis.
Protection is provided against a subset of users exhausting collective resources.

*quotacheck*: generates and updates quota accounting files.

*quotaon*: enables quota accounting.

*quotaoff*: disables quota accounting.

*edquota*: used for editing user or group quotas.

*quota*: reports on usage and limits.

Quota operations require the existence of the files *aquota.user* and *aquota.group* in the root directory of the filesystem using quotas.

Quotas may be enabled or disabled on a per-filesystem basis.
In addition, Linux supports the use of quotas based on user and group IDs.

Different filesystem types may have additional quota-related utilities, such as *xfs_quota*.

== Setting Up Quotas

To create a filesystem quota, you must first make sure you have mounted the filesystem with the user and/or group quota mount options.
Without these, nothing else will work.
The basic steps are:

* Mount the filesystem with user and/or group quota options:
 ** Add the usrquota and/or grpquota options to the filesystems entry in /etc/fstab
 ** Remount the filesystem (or mount it if new)
* Run quotacheck on the filesystem to set up quotas
* Enable quotas on the filesystem
* Set quotas with the edquota program.

First, you need to put the right options in /etc/fstab, as in:

`/dev/sda5 /home ext4 defaults,usrquota 1 2`

where we have assumed `/home` is on a dedicated partition.

Then, test with the following commands:

`$ sudo mount -o remount /home` `$ sudo quotacheck -vu /home` `$ sudo quotaon -vu /home` `$ sudo edquota someusername`

You may also want to set up grace periods with edquota.
The mount options that should be used in the `/etc/fstab` file are usrquota for user quotas and grpquota for group quotas.

== quotacheck

The `quotacheck` utility creates and updates the quota accounting files (aquota.user and aquota.group) for the filesystem.

To update user files for all filesystems in /etc/fstab with user quota options:

`$ sudo quotacheck -ua`

To update group files for all filesystems in /etc/fstab with group quota options:

`$ sudo quotacheck -ga`

To update the user file for a particular filesystem:

`$ sudo quotacheck -u [somefilesystem]`

To update the group file for a particular filesystem:

`$ sudo quotacheck -g [somefilesystem]`

Use the -v option to get more verbose output.

quotacheck is generally only run when quotas are initially turned on (or need to be updated).
The program may also be run when fsck reports errors in the filesystem when the system is starting up.

== Turning Quotas On and Off

`quotaon` is used to turn filesystem quotas on;
`quotaoff` is used to turn them off.
They are used as in:

`$ sudo quotaon [flags] [filesystem]` `$ sudo quotaoff [flags] [filesystem]`

where the flags can be:

` -a, --all turn quotas off for all filesystems -f, --off turn quotas off -u, --user operate on user quotas -g, --group operate on group quotas -p, --print-state print whether quotas are on or off -x, --xfs-command=cmd perform XFS quota command -F, --format=formatname operate on specific quota format -v, --verbose print more messages -h, --help display this help text and exit -V, --version display version information and exit ` *Note that quotaon and quotaoff programs are really one and the same and operate accordingly to which name they are called with.*

=== Examples:

` $ sudo quotaon -av /dev/sda6 [/]: group quotas turned on /dev/sda5 [/home]: user quotas turned on `

` $ sudo quotaoff -av /dev/sda6 [/]: group quotas turned off /dev/sda5 [/home]: user quotas turned off `

` $ sudo quotaon -avu /dev/sda5 [/home]: user quotas turned on `

` $ sudo quotaoff -avu /dev/sda5 [/home]: user quotas turned off `

` $ sudo quotaon -avg /dev/sda6 [/]: group quotas turned on `

` $ sudo quotaoff -avg /dev/sda6 [/]: group quotas turned off `

*quota operations will fail if the files aquota.user or aquota.group do not exist.*

== Examining Quotas

The quota utility is used to generate reports on quotas:

* quota (or quota -u) returns your current user quota.
* quota -g returns your current group quota.
* The superuser may look at quotas for any user or group by specifying a user or group name.

For example:

`$ sudo quota george` ` Disk quotas for user george (uid 1000): Filesystem blocks quota limit grace files quota limit grace /dev/sda5 837572 500 1000 5804 0 0 `

`$ sudo quota gracie` ` Disk quotas for user gracie (uid 1001): Filesystem blocks quota limit grace files quota limit grace /dev/sda5 83757 5000 10000 5804 0 0 `

== Setting Quotas

Typing edquota brings up the quota editor.
For the specified user or group, a temporary file is created with a text representation of the current disk quotas for that user or group.

Then, an editor is invoked for that file, and quotas may then be modified.
Once you leave the editor, the temporary file is read and the binary quota files adopt the changes.

The only fields which can be edited in the quota are the soft and hard limits.
The other fields are informational only.

Below are examples of how to use edquota:

. `$ sudo edquota -u [username]` edits limits for username
. `$ sudo edquota -g [groupname]` edits limits for groupname
. `$ sudo edquota -u -p [userproto] [username]` copies userproto's user quota values to username
. `$ sudo edquota -g -p [groupproto] [groupname]` copies groupproto's group quota values to groupname
. `$ sudo edquota -t` to set grace period

The third and fourth commands are useful for including in scripts which might be used to create new accounts and set quotas for them.

Quotas for users and groups may be set for disk blocks and/or inodes.
In addition, soft and hard limits may be set, as well as grace periods: Soft limits may be exceeded for a grace period.
Hard limits may never be exceeded.

The grace period is set on a per-filesystem basis.

`$ sudo edquota gracie` `$ sudo edquota -t`

== `df`: Filesystem Usage

The df (disk free) utility examines filesystem capacity and usage.
In the example below, the -h option means "human-readable" (i.e., in KB, MB, GB, not bytes) and -T shows the filesystem type.
Using the -i option would show inode information instead of bytes.

== `du`: Disk Usage

`du` (disk usage) is used to evaluate both disk capacity and usage.

To display disk usage for the current directory:

`$ du`

To list all files, not just directories:

`$ du -a`

To list in human-readable format:

`$ du -h`

To display disk usage for a specific directory:

`$ du -h somedir` image:../../_resources/d2484f5168854f6c83a627d8eb27962d.png[99947aaa24c27974910613d0348d2801.png]

== Lab 19.1. Managing Swap Space

Examine your current swap space by doing: `$ cat /proc/swaps` ` Filename        Type            Size     Used   Priority    /dev/sda11      partition       4193776  0      -1 `

We will now add more swap space by adding either a new partition or a file.
To use a file we can do: `$ dd if=/dev/zero of=swpfile bs=1M count=1024` ` 1024+0 records in 1024+0 records out 1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 1.30576 s, 822 MB/s ` `$ mkswap swpfile` ` Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 1048572 KiB no label, UUID=85bb62e5-84b0-4fdd-848b-4f8a289f0c4c ` (For a real partition just feed mkswap the partition name, but be aware all data on it will be erased!) Activate the new swap space: `$ sudo swapon swpfile` ` swapon: /tmp/swpfile: insecure permissions 0664, 0600 suggested.
swapon: /tmp/swpfile: insecure file owner 500, 0 (root) suggested.

Filesystem Quotas 1.
Change the entry in /etc/fstab for your new filesystem to use user quotas (change noexec to usrquota in the entry for /mnt/tempdir).
Then remount the filesystem.
2.
Initialize quotas on the new filesystem, and then turn the quota checking system on.
3.
Now set some quota limits for the normal user account: a soft limit of 500 blocks and a hard limit of 1000 blocks.
4.
As the normal user, attempt to use dd to create some files to exceed the quota limits.
Create bigfile1 (200 blocks) and bigfile2 (400 blocks).
You should get a warning.
Why?
5.
Create bigfile3 (600 blocks).
You should get an error message.
Why?
Look closely at the file sizes.
6.
Eliminate the persistent mount line you inserted in /etc/fstab.
