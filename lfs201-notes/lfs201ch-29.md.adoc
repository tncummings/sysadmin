Chapter 29 - Containers Overview

= Chapter 29 - Containers Overview

== Chapter 29 Introduction

Containers offer a lighter weight method to isolate an application or set of applications from other running processes.
Unlike virtual machines, each of which constitutes a complete operating system, multiple containers can run simultaneously on one system, which can be either a virtualized one or a physical one.

A very common method of deploying containers is to use Docker, which we will discuss in some detail.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Understand the basic parameters and methods that define containers.
* Understand the difference between containers and virtual machines.
* Be familiar with Docker and know the steps necessary to use it properly.
* Use the major commands associated with containers and Docker.

== Container Basics

Further integration between the hypervisor and the Linux kernel allowed the creation of operating system-level virtual machines, or containers.
Containers share many facilities in the Linux kernel, and make use of some recent kernel additions, such as namespaces and cgroups.
Containers are very lightweight and reduce the overhead associated with having whole virtual machines.

The first flavor of containers was the OS container.
This type of container runs an image of an operating system with the ability to run init processes and spawn multiple applications.

LXC (Linux Containers) is one example.

== Application Virtualization

In an effort to further reduce the overhead associated with virtual machines, application virtualization is rising in popularity.
Application virtualization runs one application for each container.
Many single application containers are typically initialized on a single machine.
Using smaller components creates a greater flexibility and reduces overhead normally associated with virtualization.

Docker is one such project.

== Containers vs. Virtual Machines

Both Virtual Machines and Containers satisfy important needs.
For a while, each facility had its day in the sun, and was seen as the way to go for almost everything.

Both have long histories:

* Mainframe computers have had software partitioning and virtual machines for decades, in rather specialized ways.
* Operating systems have had chroot and BSD Jail implementations for many years, that share a basic isolation motivation with containers.

If a number of different services and applications need to be tightly integrated, a virtual machine functioning as a service may be the best solution.

If the applications being run were written expecting a complete operating system environment with a wide range of services and other libraries and applications, virtual machines may be best.

Virtual machines run a complete operating system, and can run many services and applications.
Virtual machines use more resources than a container.
Containers usually run one thing.
Containers are more portable, and can be run inside a VM.
Containers are harder to secure.
They usually start faster.
Multiple containers share one OS kernel, while each VM has its own.

Scaling workloads is different for containers and virtual machines.
Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes or Mesos can decide on the proper quantity of containers needed, do load balancing, replicate images and remove them, etc., as needed.

Overall, virtual machines are still often the best solution.

== Docker

Docker is an application-level virtualization using many individual images to build up the necessary services to support the target application.
These images are packaged into containers - they are components in containers.
Images may contain:

* Application code
* Runtime libraries
* System tools
* Or just about anything required for an application.

Images may reside on a Docker Hub or a registry server.

The https://docs.docker.com/[Docker website] has documentation, tutorials, and training information.

One of the most compelling features of Docker is that an application can be packaged up with all of its dependent code and services and deployed as a single unit with the minimum of overhead.
This deployment can be easily repeated as often as desired.
This reduces the requirement of building up a server with layered services to support the end application.

== Docker Steps

Starting up a Docker containerized application may include only a few steps:

* Install the Docker service package with your favorite tool
* Start the Docker service
* Search for an appropriate image from Docker Hub or your private repository
* Pull the image
* Run the image
* And finally, test the application.

The steps detailed above are just a very minimal example of testing a Docker application.

There are, of course, many, many options that may be used, including functions that create an image, set system variables or configuration parameters, and then, store the result as a new image.
In some cases, a writable image is required, rather than a non-writable one.

Most of the Docker commands have individual man pages.
Examples include: docker(1), docker-search(1), docker-pull(1), docker-create(1), and docker-run(1).

== `docker` Command

The docker command has more than 40 sub-commands, some with 50 or more options.
To learn more about the docker command, you can always do:

`$ docker <command> --help`

The many docker sub-commands tend to be somewhat self-documenting.
Often confused are `run`, `create` and `exec`.
The `ps` command will list running containers, or all containers, if you include the `-all` option.

docker run will start a new container and execute a command within.
Common options are `-t` to attach to a tty, and `-d` to run the container in the background.

The docker `create` command creates a container.
It has many options for configuring container settings and attachments.

If the container is already running, and you want to execute something inside of it, you can use the docker `exec` command.
It also accepts the `-t` and `-d` options.

The docker `images` command will show images in various outputs.
The docker rmi command will remove images and delete untagged parents by default.

You can also leverage shell functions to operate upon all containers.
For example, to remove all stopped containers, you can do:

`$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`

== Podman

RHEL8/CentOS8 have replaced pure docker with podman.

Podman uses a child/parent forking model for container creation and management, while Docker uses a server/client model with a daemon running in background for management.

We will show how to run the lab exercise on RHEL/CentOS 8 using the docker emulation layer.
Emulation layer enables backwards compatibility with docker commands.

Other distributions are likely to add podman in the future.
In the meantime it should be possible to add it through standard techniques.
For example, to install podman on Ubuntu, the following steps are recommended:

`$ sudo apt update` `$ sudo apt install software-properties-common` `$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:projectatomic/ppa` `$ sudo apt update` `$ sudo apt install podman`

Promised benefits include better security and less overhead.

== Lab 29.1. Installing and Testing Apache (httpd) as a Docker Application

In this exercise,  we will install,  run and test the docker package, and follow with getting and deploying httpd,  the Apache web server container.
1.
Make sure Dockeris installed (or emulated with podman.)  2.
Start the docker service: Very Important You can skip to the next step on podman-based systems as there is no docker service to start!
